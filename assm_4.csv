0,Iceland Review,Custody of Domestic Terror Suspects Extended by Two Weeks,2022/11/11,"The two individuals suspected of planning a domestic terror attack will be held in custody for another two weeks, Vísir reports. A defence attorney has called the decision “incomprehensible” in light of a psychiatric assessment that held that the men were neither a danger to themselves nor others. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had discussed carrying out attacks against political figures, among them Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and Chairman of Efling, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir. As noted by Vísir yesterday, the two men were initially placed in custody on the basis of investigative interests, but the current extension, as confirmed by the Reykjavík District Court, was predicated on public interest, with the men believed to be a danger to the public. In an interview with Vísir yesterday, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, defence attorney for one of the men, stated that the decision was founded on a threat analysis carried out by the National Police Department. “I’ve criticised the fact that the threat assessment, which actually predated the psychiatric assessment, did not take the psychiatric assessment into account.” According to Sveinn, the psychiatrist who carried out the assessment at the behest of the police did not believe the men to be a threat to themselves or others. The District Court, however, did not take this assessment into account. Sveinn Andri added that his client would be appealing the District Court’s decision, which was a big disappointment, to the Court of Appeal. “It’s always disappointing for individuals who are in custody without good reason to have to remain in custody. But we’ll simply have to deal with it and try to have the decision overturned in the Court of Appeals. That would be ideal.” In late October, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson dismissed private messages between the suspects as a “failed attempt at humour,” adding that he did not believe that either of the men would be charged with planning a terrorist attack.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
1,Iceland Review,Optimism for Icelandic Language in the Digital Age,2022/11/10,"The integration of the Icelandic language into digital services and devices has improved rapidly over the last few months, with large leaps in speech recognition. Nana Bule, a representative for Microsoft, stated to RÚV: “We’ve been fortunate enough to have really high quality data sets on the Icelandic language, which means that we’ve in very short time improved language recognition for Icelandic by 32%. Which may sound small, but is actually a very big improvement that would normally have taken 5 to 10 years.” Earlier this May, an Icelandic delegation including President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja D. Alfreðsdóttir met with American tech companies to discuss the further integration of the Icelandic language into digital services and devices. Following the May meetings, representatives from Microsoft have been visiting Iceland this week to report on progress made. Now, the meetings seem to be bearing fruit, with surprisingly fast improvements for the integration of Icelandic into digital services. Mrs. Bule stated that Icelanders will soon be able to speak Icelandic to their devices without a problem. Bule also stated with regard to speech recognition: “We can already do that today, but my hope is that in the future, we will be able to do it much more fluently. In the future, an interview could be you asking me questions in Icelandic, me answering in English, but listeners could hear it in Icelandic hopefully because we’ll be able to translate it in real time.” President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson said with regard to the innovations that it will be essential for the future of the Icelandic language to have a place in the digital sphere as well.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

3,Iceland Review,Iceland Moves to Reduce Marine Bycatch in Light of New US Import Regulations,2022/11/09,"Icelandic regulators are making moves to conform to new regulations of seafood imports in the United States, according to the latest information from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. In an effort to promote more sustainable fishing practices among exporting nations, the US has announced the introduction of new regulations which limit the acceptable amount of marine bycatch produced by fishing. Originally announced in 2016 with a 5-year grace period for nations to conform to the new regulations, the implementation has been delayed in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving Icelandic fisheries extra time to meet the new rules. Especially important in the Icelandic context is the amount of seabirds and seals affected by lumpfish fishing, a fishery traditionally for small boat fishermen. Some Icelanders have expressed concerns that the new regulations will disproportionately affect small-scale rural fishermen, who are already suffering economically. According to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, Iceland has already launched measures in response to the new US regulations. Increased monitoring is being implemented, using ship logs, drones, and geospatial modelling to better understand the distribution of bycatch. In response to the poor state of the seal population in Iceland, the direct hunting of seals has been banned. It is now forbidden to shoot seals to scare them away from fish farms, for instance. Other methods are also being investigated to reduce bycatch, such as the use of sound repellents on fishing gear. By both increasing the monitoring of wild fishing stocks, and also increasingly monitoring registered bycatch, Icelandic authorities hope to gain a fuller picture of their success in implementing these changes. Another concern is that the relatively higher bycatch of smaller fisheries, such as lumpfish, could adversely affect the status of larger, more lucrative fisheries, such as cod. According to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, while it is certain that seafood from fisheries with bycatch in excess of US guidelines will be prevented from entering the market, there is as of yet no final word on how seafood from other fisheries will be handled. It is also as of yet unclear whether the steps taken by Icelandic authorities will be considered sufficient to meet the US conditions. The US regulations, after a delay, are now slated to come into effect on January 1, 2024.    ","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
4,Iceland Review,Mouse Infestation “Unlike Anything” Exterminator Has Seen,2022/11/08,"In an interview with RÚV, a seasoned exterminator has stated that Iceland is currently experiencing a mouse infestation the likes of which he’s never seen. He encourages people to take the necessary precautions. Despite their small stature, mice can be an outsized pest for homeowners. Árni Logi Sigurbjörnsson, an exterminator of 43 years, has been busy over the past days – in light of a countrywide mouse infestation. “The infestation traces its roots to favourable weather conditions,” Árni told RÚV. “Flush growth of vegetation last spring has meant plenty of nourishment for mice. Then when you have these long days of rain and the temperature begins to drop – hovering around freezing during nights – they begin to seek shelter in cars and homes, cottages and bales, because mouseholes aren’t exactly ideal.” Árni recommends that individuals take good care of their possessions by taking the necessary precautions and installing mousetraps; mice can squeeze in through holes as small as ten millimetres. “I encourage people to be on their guard because mice, even though they’re small, can wreak great damage.”            ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
5,Iceland Review,Protests in Front of Parliament in Wake of Deportations,2022/11/07,"Protestors last week flocked to Austurvöllur square in front of Iceland’s parliament in response to the recent deportation of Icelandic refugees. The protests took place Thursday, November 3, and Sunday, November 6 with some thousand people in attendance. The recent wave of deportations is the largest in recent history in Iceland, with some refugees being deported as their applications for asylum status were still under consideration by the Directorate of Immigration. Isavia, the company responsible for running Keflavík International Airport, has also come under critique for its involvement in the deportations. The Journalists’ Association of Iceland has accused Isavia of obstructing the work of journalists covering the deportations, turning floodlights against a crowd of reporters. Isavia has published a statement regretting their involvement, saying that they were following police instructions, who requested that Isavia staff prevent filming of the deportations.

According to Icelandic police, they are now considering having vehicles more suitable for wheelchairs. Further critique has been raised by the confiscation of refugees’ phones. Icelandic police state that the refugees’ phones were taken from them in order to ensure their safety. Helgi Valberg Jensson, Chief Legal Office of the National Police, stated to Vísir: “We had individuals in custody, and it was our duty to ensure their safety.  Whether this needs to be revised is something we will consider moving forward.” Police body cameras were also reported to have been turned off during portions of the raids. Helgi has stated that this for the privacy of individuals who may feel uncomfortable. Among the critics of the recent deportations are the United Nations Children’s Fund in Iceland, the Icelandic branch of Amnesty International, the Disabled Persons’ Association, the Red Cross in Iceland and the Icelandic Teachers’ Association.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
6,Iceland Review,Council of Europe to be Held in Reykjavík,2022/11/07,"The Council of Europe is to be held in Reykjavík in May of next year. The meeting is to be the fourth-ever meeting in the organisation’s 73-year history, taking place 16-17 May, 2023. The Council of Europe, a distinct organisation from the European Union, is an international body tasked with upholding human rights and rule of law in Europe. Founded after the Second World War, its best-known body is the European Court of Human Rights. Faced with new crises in Europe, from the war in Ukraine and the accompanying energy crisis to the economic disruptions of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation has announced that it is time to redouble efforts to promote democracy and justice in Europe. Some 46 nations are party to the Council of Europe #Breaking @coe Committee of Ministers just adopted decision to hold 4th Summit of Heads of State/Gov in 🇮🇸Reykjavik in May 2023. Opportunity for leaders of 46 Council of Europe Member States to unite & recommit to the core principles – human rights, democracy & rule of law. pic.twitter.com/wp2CuASGMf In a press release from the Council of Europe, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated: “It is a great honour for Iceland to be the host of the 4th Summit of Heads of State and Government. Iceland is convinced that the Council of Europe – the continent’s oldest and leading pan-European organization – has a critical role to play as the region’s guardian of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. Together, we must continue to ensure that the Council of Europe is fit for purpose to meet current and future challenges as well as the expectations of future generations. We applaud the Irish presidency for their in-depth work on the role of the Council and look forward to working with all the Council’s Member States to reaffirm our common commitment to the Council’s core principles.” Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić also stated: “The decision to hold a Fourth Summit of Heads of State and Governments is timely and right. I congratulate the Committee of Ministers on taking it.

7,Iceland Review,Opioid Abuse Among Young People Growing More Common,2022/11/04,"Opioid abuse among individuals 25 years old and younger has grown more common, according to Dr. Valgerður Rúnarsdóttir, the Medical Director of SÁÁ (the National Centre of Addiction Medicine). Valgerður addressed the audience at a conference at the Hilton Nordica hotel yesterday, Mbl.is reports. Speaking to Iceland Review last month, Dr. Valgerður Rúnarsdóttir, the Medical Director of SÁÁ (National Centre of Addiction Medicine) stated that talk of a “new opioid crisis” in Iceland was not an exaggeration. Referring to the data, Valgerður noted that between 2010 and 2022, the percentage of patients being treated for opioid addiction at the Vogur detox centre and rehabilitation hospital rose by approximately 200% (from 10.3% to ca. 30% of the clinic’s patients). Furthermore, these patients are twice as likely to relapse than others, and thirty-five of those who have sought treatment over the past five years have died. Read More: In Harm’s Way: Harm Reduction in the Age of Opioids Yesterday, Valgerður addressed the audience at a conference held by SÁÁ and FÁR (the Association of Alcohol and Drug Advisors) at the Hilton Nordica hotel in Reykjavík between November 2 and 3. According to her lecture, prescription opioid abuse – including opioids like Contalgin, Oxycontin, and Fentanyl – among individuals 25 and younger has grown more common. Although opioid abuse is on the rise, alcohol is still the most commonly abused intoxicant in Iceland. Speaking to Mbl.is, Valgerður noted that the problems were “of a different nature” when individuals are abusing potent prescription drugs. Valgerður also noted that the percentage of working individuals who are admitted to the Vogur rehabilitation centre has declined to 30%. Given this, it was important that the Icelandic Vocational Rehabilitation Fund (VIRK) no longer mandates a 3-6 month sober period as a condition for entering into vocational rehabilitation. The aforementioned conference was the first to be sponsored jointly by SÁÁ and FÁR. Valgerður told Mbl.is that many parties, including VIRK, FÁR, SÁÁ, and municipal authorities, are determined to work together to combat substance abuse in Iceland.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
8,Iceland Review,Arrest of Refugee Raises Critique,2022/11/03,"Freyja Haraldsdóttir, an advocate for the disabled in the capital area, said that the rights of a disabled refugee were not respected when he was arrested last night, November 2. A lawyer representing the man is now preparing a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights, according to Vísir. The man, originally from Iraq, is in Iceland with a family of five, all of whom were scheduled to be deported to Greece last night. This is alongside several other deportation-related arrests that have been made in the last week, with several refugees and asylum seekers now in police custody. He is also wheelchair-bound and has received important medical treatment during his time in Iceland. His entire family was arrested yesterday and taken to a hotel in Hafnafjörður for their deportation, but the man was later removed from the hotel by police officers. Freyja Haraldsdóttir has stated to Vísir that the man’s rights were violated when he has not provided with an advocate. As a disabled person, Freyja stated, he was in a particularly vulnerable position: “He has the right to have a lawyer to support him, both to inform him about what is going on and what the next steps are, to ensure that he understands everything that is going on, make sure that he can speak his mind, and make sure that appropriate accommodations are made so that he does not suffer harm in his situation.” The incident has sparked controversy on social media, with a photo depicting police officers forcibly removing the man from his wheelchair in wide circulation.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
9,Iceland Review,September Recording-Breaking Month for Tourism,2022/11/02,"In a report by Statistics Iceland, overnight stays in hotel accommodations in Iceland are shown to be 7,144,400 for the year so far. This represents a 2% increase from 2018, the previous record-breaking year before the global pandemic. Should the trend hold, 2022 could be the busiest year ever in the Icelandic tourism industry. In September of this year, some 853,500 overnight stays in hotel accommodations were recorded, representing a 27% increase from September 2021. Approximately 81% of these overnight stays can be accounted for by foreign tourists, or around 691,000 stays. Icelanders and residents of Iceland accounted for the remaining 19%, at around 161,000 overnight stays. Compared with September 2021, this represents a slight decrease in the amount of domestic tourism, when Icelanders were generally more represented during the travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19.   Not surprisingly, the region of Iceland with the largest yearly increase was the capital region, with an 11.8% increase in overnight stays from September 2021 to September 2022. Following the capital region were West Iceland and the West Fjords, with an 8.3% increase in the same period. The region least affected by the recent upswing was East Iceland, with a negligible 0.5% increase in overnight stays year-on-year. The total supply of hotel rooms has also risen since last year. This summer saw an acute shortage of accommodations in Iceland, driving many prices up. Statistics Iceland reports now an 8% increase in hotel capacity, with an average occupancy over the year of around 79%.  ","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
10,Iceland Review,Sixteen Middle Managers at Landspítali Hospital Dismissed,2022/11/01,"Sixteen middle managers employed at the National University Hospital of Iceland received letters of termination yesterday, RÚV reports. The terminations stem from the adoption of a new organisational chart intended to improve the hospital’s operations. A new organisational chart will come into effect at the National University Hospital on January 1. According to director Runólfur Pálsson, the organisational chart is intended to simplify the hospital’s operations and make them more efficient. “The main purpose is to get a handle on the hospital’s management and operations, to strengthen our clinical services, and to harmonise other key services,” Runólfur remarked in an interview with RÚV. Over the past months, questions concerning the sustainability of the hospital’s operations have come to the fore. When asked if these changes would be felt by the public, Runólfur replied: “I hope it’ll translate into a stronger hospital, that we’ll be able to improve our service: improve our emergency services, the flow of patients while also strengthening our surgical department. If we’re successful in this regard, then the public will certainly feel it.” The hospital’s organisational chart was introduced to the Minister of Health today. The changes imply a decrease in the number of middle managers and increased responsibility among front-line managers. “Six directorial positions will be cut, but there are two positions that are bound by law, namely the directorship of nurses and medicine – but the other six will be cut alongside all of the ten managerial positions,” Runólfur remarked. As reported by RÚV, the sixteen individuals holding the aforementioned positions received a letter of notice yesterday. Runólfur added that because the organisational chart had yet to be implemented, it remained to be seen whether it would result in increased efficiency. “These are big changes, and we must be aware that changes to the organisational chart, in themselves, are not enough to improve our output – there are other things that must work out as well,” Runólfur stated. “But the purpose of these changes is to get a better handle on and harmonise our clinical services. In the near future, we will aim to overhaul all of the clinical organisational units in the front line and strengthen its management affording them greater responsibility.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
11,Iceland Review,Record Number of Coronavirus Deaths Since Start of 2022,2022/11/01,"Deaths from COVID-19 have hit a record high, Vísir reports, with 188 people having died from the coronavirus since the beginning of 2022. According to Chief Epidemiologist Guðrún Aspelund, the effect of COVID-19 far outweighs the effects of other infectious diseases such as influenza. Deaths from COVID-19 have surged since the start of 2022, Vísir reports. Thirty-one people died from the coronavirus in 2020 compared to eight in 2021. During the first ten months of 2022, however, that number has risen to 188. According to Chief Epidemiologist Guðrún Aspelund, this upswing in cases owes primarily to the highly infectious Omicron variant and the fact that no social restrictions are in place. Deaths have mainly occurred among individuals seventy years and older. “Which is why we’re encouraging older people, everyone sixty years and older, and those who are at risk, to get their booster shots. That’s the best form of protection,” Guðrún remarked, adding that protection from vaccines diminishes over a period of a few months. “We’ve also got new vaccines now that offer protection against the original variant of coronavirus and Omicron, which offers better protection. We need to repeat these vaccinations to enter into winter with good protection.” Read More: Long-form Interview with former chief epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason Guðrún observed that Iceland’s neighbouring countries have also been seeing a rise in cases in 2022. “Confirmed deaths from COVID-19 are believed to be around six and a half million. But there are many who believe that those figures are at least twice as high – thousands of people are still dying from coronavirus every week.” According to Guðrún, deaths from coronavirus are significantly higher than deaths from influenza. Coronavirus deaths in Iceland are, however, lower when compared to other countries, with Iceland having the lowest death toll among the Nordic countries. When asked to speculate why, Guðrún pointed to Iceland’s speedy vaccination campaign, its social restrictions, and the fact that the healthcare system had responded well. “I think we can chalk up this achievement to these factors along with the participation of the citizenry.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

The current case concerns cattle in Borgarfjörður that have been reportedly abused. According to information from MAST, the livestock are no longer in the farmer’s custody. According to RÚV, neighbours of the farm have complained about conditions on the farm, saying that the animals have inadequate water and shelter against the elements. According to the neighbours, livestock on the farm are often locked inside for long periods, and the cattle that are seen outside are often malnourished to the point of deformity. The owner of the cattle in question has also been reported as having a difficult relationship with his neighbours in past, with some saying that he has shown threatening behaviour.

13,Iceland Review,Emergency Shelters Not Able to Cope with High Numbers of Unhoused People,2022/10/31,"Hrafnhildur Ólöf Ólafsdóttir, nurse and head of the City of Reykjavík working group on homelessness, has stated in a recent interview with RÚV that following a large increase in the use of homeless shelters in the last two years, the system can no longer cope with the large demand placed on it. According to the latest information from the Welfare Council, some 87 women and 214 men remain unhoused in Reykjavík. 30% of this group use emergency shelters, with around another 50% in residential facilities. Hrafnhildur stated to RÚV that the crisis had many causes: “It’s connected to many factors, especially the housing and rental market, and reduced access now to guesthouses, hotels, and hostels, which we had access to during the pandemic.“ Emergency shelters in Reykjavík are now consistently at and above their limits, compared with 2021 where utilization of shelters sat between 60-80%, and in 2020, when it sat around 30-50%. Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that around a third of Reykavík’s unhoused come from other municipalities. Hrafnhildur stated: “It’s not that people are choosing to come to Reykjavík, we are simply the only municipality that offers these services. Other resources need to be developed and allocated elsewhere, too.” See our Ask Iceland Review on homelessness in Iceland for more information.    ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
14,Iceland Review,The Climate Disaster Has “Already Begun to Materialise”,2022/10/28,"The international community is “falling far short of the Paris goals,” a new UN report finds. “The disaster has already begun to materialise,” Halldór Þorgeirsson, Chair of Iceland’s Climate Council, told RÚV yesterday. Yesterday, October 27, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) published its 2022 edition of the Emissions Gap report. The report provides an update on the progress towards “achieving national mitigation pledges” and the goals set by the Paris Agreement by taking stock of the so-called “emissions gap.” As noted by a UN press release, the report concludes that the international community is “falling far short of the Paris goals, with no credible pathway to 1.5°C in place.” The authors state that the only way to avoid climate disaster is via an urgent “system-wide transformation.” Read More: The Age of Eco-Anxiety “Global and national climate commitments are falling pitifully short,” Secretary General of the UN António Guterres stated in a video message during an introduction of the report yesterday. “We must close the emissions gap before climate catastrophe closes in on us all.” To address the report’s findings, RÚV invited the Chair of Iceland’s Climate Council Halldór Þorgeirsson (and a retired Senior Director at the UN Climate Change Secretariat) to an interview during yesterday’s nightly news. Halldór was blunt: “These disasters have already begun to materialise, and this year, we have seen disasters that are truly man-made. The strongest example being Pakistan, and, just as bad, and nearer to home, Florida. “These things are already manifesting in such a way that it’s no longer a question of the future. Our meagre achievements means that the window of opportunity grows ever narrower; there’s much less time. That’s why the only feasible path forward is to undertake fast and extensive system-wide transformation.” The only way to do this, Halldór maintained, was increased investment. “These are large figures but in reality, it’s only about 2% of the total budget. So it certainly seems doable. Central banks play a big role, and we need to rethink the economy. That’s what this is about – alongside greater cooperation between nations.” The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) will be held from November 6 to 18 in Egypt. It will mark the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference. According to Halldór, no “big decisions” are expected to be made during the conference. “This conference will focus more on following through with the agreement,” Halldór observed. “The implementation of the Paris Agreement was concluded in Glasgow last year. During the first two days of the conference, global leaders will be present, and the messages that they send matter. All eyes will be on China. They’ve been quite reticent. Then there’s this very strong undercurrent, connected to those aforementioned disasters because one of the big questions of this conference is how we provide aid to nations who suffer such disasters.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
15,Iceland Review,Two Thirds of Reykjavík Residents Support Pedestrian Zones,2022/10/27,"The majority of Reykjavík residents view pedestrian districts in downtown positively, according to a recent poll commissioned by the City of Reykjavík from Maskína, a market research group. The recent opinion poll also reports a significant reduction in negative opinions towards pedestrian districts in the last four years. In total, 64.5% of Reykjavík residents view pedestrian districts positively, with 12.3% viewing them negatively. Interestingly, those disposed most positively towards pedestrian districts are generally those who live near and visit pedestrian districts, such as Laugavegur, often. Conversely, negative attitudes towards walking zones were also shown to cluster around those who live away from and visit walking zones less. 88% who visit walking districts weekly or more feel positively towards them. 64% of those who visit one to three times a month felt positively towards them, and only 38% of those who visited walking districts less than once a month felt positively towards them. The neighborhoods most positively disposed towards pedestrian areas were Vesturbær (80%) and downtown (78%). Among key benefits of walking districts residents of Reykjavík highlighted in the poll were positive effects on health, community, restaurants and cafés, and shopping. The poll also comes at a time when Reykjavík City is planning to expand the walking district by Austurvöllur around Dómkirkjan and Alþingi. The plans for the new walking area, which can be accessed here, will convert Kirkjustræti and Temparasund into pedestrian-only areas. The area will also receive an extensive redesign.

16,Iceland Review,Reykjavík City Proposes New Fee for Winter Tires,2022/10/26,"The Environment Agency of Iceland has introduced a new plan for air quality in the capital region which would advise local authorities to introduce new fees for studded winter tires, reports Fréttablaðið. According to air quality expert at the Environment Agency, Þorsteinn Jóhannsson, there now exists the political will to push through these new regulations, which would aim to both improve air quality by lessening the particulate matter in the air, and also lessen wear on the capital’s roads. Some, according to Þorsteinn, have stated that this would amount to a further tax burden on Iceland’s already-struggling rural communities. Because of the conditions during winter, it is practically a requirement for Iceland’s rural population to use studded tires. Þorsteinn, however, has clarified that the fee would apply principally to the capital region, and that visitors with studded tires to the capital would pay a daily fee. In this way, it would function much like a parking fee. According to Þorsteinn, investigations show that studded tires cause 20 to 40 times as much wear to roads as non-studded. Þorsteinn also notes that although the legal season for winter tires is from November 1 to April 14, there are already many studded tires on the road in Reykjavík. Alexandra Briem, chairperson of the city council, has also stated her support for such a fee, noting that additional methods to reduce air pollution and wear on roads are needed.

17,Iceland Review,US Extends Deadline for Marine Mammal Bycatch Regulations,2022/10/26,"In a recent announcement, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has extended the deadline for the implementation of regulations governing the import of seafood to the US. Aimed at protecting endangered species and limiting the amount of unnecessary bycatch (what is unintentionally caught by net fishing, which can include seabirds, other species of fish, seals, dolphins, and even small whales), the regulations aim to limit the import of marine products from fisheries where marine mammals are caught. This has potentially large consequences for Iceland, the US being a major export market for Icelandic seafood. The regulations were originally introduced in 2016 and gave exporting nations a 5-year period to comply with the new US regulations. However, this grace period was extended by a year, and then further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, Iceland lost its Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification in 2018 due to the large number of bycatch produced by Icelandic lumpfish fishing. Lumpfish generally stick near the shore and are thus safe from larger trawlers. This fish, prized for its roe, is still fished in small boats with nets. However, net fishing also produces large amounts of unwanted bycatch. Although Iceland has taken steps in recent years to minimizing the environmental impact of net fishing, it is a complicated situation for Icelandic fishermen, as it is generally the small boat fishermen who will be under the most pressure from the current regulations. Iceland’s small boat fishermen have already been sidelined in many ways by the current quota system. Although the bycatch problem is indeed important, it leaves some wondering if the burden of environmental responsibility is being placed excessively on small, independent fishermen.    ","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0

The Global Innovation Index is “an annual ranking of countries by their capacity for, and success in, innovation.” The index – started in 2007 by INSEAD and World Business – is published by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and is based on both subjective and objective data derived from several sources, including the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum. Falling three places from 2021, Iceland ranks 20th according to this year’s index (the confidence interval indicates that Iceland ranks somewhere between 15th and 20th) and 12th among European countries. Read More: Idea Island (Iceland Is Investing in Innovation) As noted by the government’s website, Iceland’s standing may be somewhat skewed by its size and abundance of natural resources: “As a small country, by international standards, Iceland draws the short straw when it comes to several criteria employed by WIPO during the index’s calculus; the criteria is not patterned to small nations rich in natural resources.” To this point, Iceland scores high (14th place) in the categories Institutions and Business Sophistication, and is ranked first when it comes to the use of information and communication technologies, electricity output, share of gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) financed from abroad, number of scientific articles published per capita, national feature films, and online creativity. On the other hand, Iceland scores low when it comes to the ratio of gross-domestic-product (GDP)-to-energy-use (129th), a proxy for energy efficiency; the size of the domestic market (129th); the value of inward direct investment made by non-resident investors (127th); and graduates in science and engineering (85th). As noted in a recent article in Iceland Review magazine, Iceland may have “hopped on the startup train a bit later than other countries, but its startup environment has taken huge strides in recent years.” In 2019, the Icelandic government penned its first-ever comprehensive innovation policy, and at the end of 2020, the newly-elected government established a Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation, suggesting that policymakers are “not overlooking what startups have to offer the nation.”","Business,Sci&Tech,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
19,Iceland Review,Single-Lane Bridge Replaced with Double-Lane Bridge Near Kirkjubæjarklaustur,2022/10/24,"Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, Minister of Infrastructure, took part in the official opening of the new bridge over Jökulsá on the south coast of Iceland on Friday, October 21. With the appearance of the new bridge, there will no longer be any one-way bridges between Reykjavík and Kirkjubæjarklaustur, a town on the south coast of Iceland. The improvement is a major one for the region, meaning that the drive east along the south coast will be all the more navigable. Also present at the opening ceremony were Anton Kári Halldórsson, mayor of Rangárþing eystra, and Einar Freyr Elínarsn, mayor of Mýrdalshreppur municipality. After the ceremony, minister Sigurður was the first to drive over the new bridge, inaugurating this latest addition to Iceland’s road system. In his address at the ceremony, minister Sigurður outlined his ministry’s plans to get rid of single-lane bridges throughout the nation: “Today we move one step closer to that goal. Four years ago, 37 bridges on the Ring Road were single-lane, now there are 32, and there will be 31 when the new bridge opens today. And there is no let up in construction. I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce the number of them to 29 right before the end of the year, with new bridges openings on both Hverfisfljót and Núpsvötn later in the year. There are also three single-lane bridges that will be diverted around the Ring Road when traffic is allowed over the new bridge over the Hornafjörður River.” According to information from the Road Administration, the new bridge is some 163 m [535 ft] long, with a total width of 10 m [33 ft]. The bridge it replaces was built in 1967, part of the construction of Iceland’s Ring Road.","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
20,Iceland Review,No Gender Pay Gap in Árborg,2022/10/24,"For the first time in the municipality’s history, Árborg in South Iceland has reported no wage gap for the municipality’s thousand-some employees. Fjóla Kristinsdóttir, mayor of Árborg, stated to Vísir that she was “extremely proud of this achievement.” She noted that it was particularly impressive given the large size of the municipality and their many employees, though she also stated “this is naturally what we have to do according to the law.” On how the municipality achieved this milestone in social justice, Fjóla stated that “I’m not trying to own this accomplishment. It’s just our great staff who have been working hard on this.” There are around 1,000 employees in Árborg municipality, with women now considerably more represented than men. Now, however, the basic wage for all is the same, something that was not always the case. The news is significant in its timing as well, coming near the anniversary of Women’s Day Off. On October 24, 1975, women in Iceland staged a historic strike, now known as Women’s Day Off. With nearly 90% of Iceland’s women participating in the strike, they walked out of both jobs and domestic labour for the day. The following year, legislation ensuring equal pay was passed.  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
21,Iceland Review,The Road to Borgarfjörður Eystri Now Paved,2022/10/24,"Residents of Borgarfjörður Eystri, a village in East Iceland, can now drive on paved roads all the way to Egilsstaðir. The last section of paved road was completed earlier this month, a 15 km [9.3 mi] stretch near the town of Eiðar was finally paved. Héraðsverk, the contractor responsible for finishing the road project, reports that it was difficult going. The final section required significant blasting to clear the way. Now, however, a straight and wide road runs where there was previously a winding, gravel road with potholes. The region has seen significant improvements in infrastructure in the last years, with a new road recently finished near Njarðvík. Residents also protested in 2018 by paving sections of road themselves to highlight inaction on behalf of the municipality.   With the recent improvements, all towns in the Fljótsdalshérað municipality are now connected via paved roads, a major milestone for this remote region of Iceland. Eyþór Stefánsson, a resident of Borgarfjörður Eystri and representative in Múlaþing’s local council, is quoted as saying: “It’s amazing what’s happened in such a short time. We set off to fight to get sections of landslide-prone roads paved, but then this all started to happen incredibly fast.  We had hoped to improved the road from Eiðar but it turned out much better than we reckoned. They’ve taken away the blind rises, so now it’s a properly straight and wide road, practically a motorway.”","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
22,Iceland Review,Twice as Many Cockroach Calls This Year,2022/10/22,"While a pervasive and persistent pest in most places, cockroaches are a rarely seen phenomenon in Iceland, but their numbers seem to be on the rise, if recent exterminator callouts are any indication. RÚV reports that exterminators are reporting twice as many callouts to remove roaches this year than last. Cockroaches can’t survive long outdoors in Iceland, but they manage just fine inside. Exterminator Steinar Smári Guðbergsson has been responding to roach calls all over the country of late, from Akureyri to Vesturbær, on the west side of Reykjavík. “There’ve been quite a few calls due to cockroaches in the last six months,” he said. “I’d say they’ve increased considerably.” Steinar Smári reminds Icelanders unfamiliar with the scuttling scourge that roaches thrive in warm environments where there’s plenty of food—so people should avoid leaving dirty dishes in the sink or leftover food on counters. Indeed, cockroaches are the only insects Steinar Smári can think of that enjoy filth, and he notes that this is a good encouragement to keep one’s house clean. (He himself seems relatively unbothered by roaches, but actually became an exterminator because he was afraid of spiders when he used to live in the countryside.) Asked if he thinks cockroaches are here to stay in Iceland, Steinar Smári said, “they’ve got a foot in door, I’d say.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
23,Iceland Review,"Domestic-Terror Suspects Engaged in a “Failed Attempt at Humour,” Attorney Says",2022/10/20,"The defence attorney for one of the two men held in custody suspected of planning a domestic-terror attack has dismissed private messages between the suspects as a “failed attempt at humour.” He does not believe that either of the men will be charged with planning a terrorist attack, Vísir reports. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal confirmed the further four-week custody of two men arrested last month suspected of planning a domestic-terrorism attack. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men had also discussed carrying out attacks against political figures, among them Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and Chairman of Efling, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir. “Having spoken with my client, it appears that the police got ahead of itself in their press conferences and the like. It appears as if this is a matter of a firearms violation,” Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, the new defence attorney for one of the suspects, told Vísir. Sveinn Andri stated that his client admits to weapons offences but that the men were not planning a real domestic-terror attack, suggesting that that charge rests solely on the evidence of private messages: “It was merely a failed attempt at humour by these two boys; the idea that they had been planning an act of terrorism on public chatrooms, that just doesn’t hold any water.” “My client is a harmless wretch who wouldn’t hurt a fly. He’s as far from a terrorist as one can imagine. He has no interest in politics, believes that the Pirates are actual buccaneers and not a political party, and so on, and so forth.” When asked if he believed that the court’s primary task would be to decide whether or not private messages between the two men were “failed attempts at humour,” Sveinn replied that he was altogether unsure whether the charge of planning a terrorist attack would be brought against the two suspects. “I’m not sure that it’ll go as far as that; my feeling is that, in the end, they’ll be charged for weapons offences to which they will then admit.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
24,Iceland Review,"Parents, Community Appalled by Brutal Bullying Case",2022/10/20,"Sædís Hrönn Samúelsdóttir and her twelve-year-old daughter Ísabella Von Sædísardóttir opened up to local media yesterday about the brutal campaign of bullying that the latter has suffered at the hands of classmates. Abusers encouraged Ísabella to “try again,” following a failed suicide attempt. Parents must shoulder greater responsibility, the Chair of Hafnarfjörður’s City Council has stated. As reported by RÚV yesterday, Ísabella Von is an eighth-grader at the Hraunvallaskóli primary school in Hafnarfjörður. Having long been bullied by her classmates, she recently attempted suicide by overdosing on her mother’s prescription drugs. Ísabella notified her mother, who drove her to the Children’s Hospital for treatment. She returned home yesterday. “I felt like everyone would be happy if I went through with it. That’s what everyone has told me,” Ísabella told RÚV. Sædís Hrönn Samúelsdóttir, Ísabella’s mother, maintains that she can name at least 35 children who have sent her daughter hateful messages; although the ones sent anonymously are worse. Ísabella has also been attacked physically twice, once at the Smáralind shopping mall, which was recorded and shared on social media. After the beating, she received the following message: “She probably began fucking bawling. If there hadn’t been people around, she probably would have been fucking dead (…) You should have been fucking dead, Ísabella.” Sædís says that psychologists with the National Agency for Children and Family have tried to offer assistance; that they’ve applied for so-called MST intervention, which is a cross-institutional treatment geared towards aiding parents in helping their children cope. “The school has also tried to help, but she just doesn’t show up,” Sædís remarked. After news of the bullying broke, the Parents’ Association of Hraunvallaskóli released a public statement on Facebook. The association was “shocked by revelations” in the media yesterday and has called a meeting with school administrators. “It’s important to tackle such matters with determination and to activate protocols. Also, we, as parents, administrators, and school employees must work together toward constructive solutions that put our children’s welfare first. The Parents’ Association will try its utmost, circumstances allowing.” Mayor of Hafnarfjörður Rósa Guðbjartsdóttir also weighed in on the matter on Facebook yesterday, encouraging a show of empathy, responsibility, and love. “It’s been heartrending, hearing of the violence that our young girl in Hafnarfjörður has suffered. All of the world’s specialists […] will never replace us as custodians and parents. Let us talk to our children, monitor their activities more closely, explain to them the seriousness of their actions and the consequences of treating other people poorly. The simple message: ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’ It is so important and true.” Speaking to RÚV yesterday, Valdimar Víðisson, Chair of Hafnarfjörður’s City Council, stated that bullying was not endemic to Hafnarfjörður. “Bullying in primary school is, unfortunately, our current reality. We must find ways to respond.” Valdimar says that social media is playing an increasingly larger role. “It’s a reality with which we’ve been unable to adequately deal,” Valdimar observed, adding that some of the options available are helpful, although uprooting bullying always necessitates the involvement of parents. “It’s often the case that schools are left screaming into the void because there isn’t a lot of participation. But parents must take part, as well as society at large.” If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, reach out to Red Cross Iceland (Phone No. 1717) or the Píeta Association (Phone No. 552-2218)",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
25,Iceland Review,ISK 20 Million to Support E-Sports,2022/10/19,"Reykjavík City Council approved a grant proposal yesterday to fund sports clubs with e-sports teams. The funding will total some ISK 20 million.
 Björn Gíslason, city councilperson, has stated his support of the proposal to Vísir, saying that there are high costs to starting e-sports leagues, and that the government’s assistance is important. “It is my dream that electronic sports are implemented in all sports clubs in Reykjavík, especially with the goal of preventing social isolation and increasing the social skills of children and teenagers,” Björn said.
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the proposal has been critiqued by representatives from the Independence Party, with some suggesting that e-sports are not an appropriate or important field for government support. Notably, Iceland already has a relatively established e-sports gaming scene. Local sports clubs have been home to e-sports teams since 2018. Iceland has also hosted several important e-sports tournaments, having an advantage especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with relatively relaxed restrictions on gatherings. Because e-sports are generally at home in high-tech nations, such as South Korea, Japan, China, and also other Nordics such as Denmark and Sweden, the Icelandic e-sports community has tried to make its mark among these peers. Supporters of the grant for funding also highlight the role that e-sports play in young peoples’ lives. Like traditional sports, they claim, they encourage young people to work together with their peers and form social bonds. Proponents have pointed to the role of e-sports in self discipline, emotional management, responsibility, and other important aspects of childhood development.","Sci&Tech,Society",0,0,0,0,1,0
26,Iceland Review,Strætó Discontinues Night-Time Service During Weekends,2022/10/18,"Strætó has announced that it will discontinue its night-time bus service in Reykjavík during the weekends, citing low passenger demand during a special trial period. Strætó is facing financial troubles following the pandemic, and recently, the capital area municipalities had to divert extra fund to keep the regional partnership company from insolvency. In early July, Strætó (the public bus service in Iceland) announced that the Reykjavík night bus, Næturstrætó, would return to service on July 9 following a two-year hiatus in response to low demand during the pandemic. During this hiatus, many capital-area residents had called for its return, arguing that it provided an affordable and safe alternative to taxis. During a trial run between July and October of this year, however – when the night bus departed downtown Reykjavík every hour and stopped at the capital area’s seven suburban neighbourhoods – demand once again proved wanting. As noted in a press release from Strætó, an average of 15 passengers travelled aboard the night bus during each trip, which amounts to approximately 300 passengers over a weekend. “In light of this, and given the finances, Strætó’s board has agreed that continuing night-time service during the weekends, now that the trial period has concluded, cannot be justified. The service will, therefore, be discontinued.” As noted by Vísir, transportation options from downtown Reykjavík after the night clubs have closed during the weekend are limited; operating electric scooters while intoxicated is illegal and securing transportation via taxis often proves difficult.  ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
27,Iceland Review,Would-Be Terrorists Discussed Killing Minister Guðlaugur Þór,2022/10/18,"The two men being held in police custody accused of planning a domestic terrorism attack in Iceland had reportedly discussed killing Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson – Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. Last Friday, the District Court of Reykjavík approved the District Attorney’s request to extend their custody by four weeks. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had reportedly discussed carrying out an attack during the police’s annual celebration (which was held on October 1). Yesterday, RÚV reported that the suspects had also discussed killing Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. The Chief of Police reportedly notified the Minister of the suspects’ intentions prior to calling the Minister in for questioning. As reported on October 10, the suspects had also discussed targeting Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir and Gunnar Smári Egilsson, chairperson of the Socialist Party. The names of current and former Pirate Party politicians were also mentioned as possible targets. The police have asked a psychiatrist to assess the earnestness of the remarks made by the men during private messages, with the suspects’ lawyers contending that the threats were empty. Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson has stated that this is the “first investigation of its kind” to be launched in Iceland.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
28,Iceland Review,Directorate of Education to be Abolished,2022/10/17,"Extensive changes to Iceland’s education system were announced today in a press release by Minister of Education and Childrens’ Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason. In order to strengthen schools across the nation, a new general framework on education is to be established, replacing the Directorate of Education. The new framework is part of the government’s outline for an education policy to the year 2030, which seeks to re-organise several offices in order to better assure quality and access to education for children from kindergarten to secondary school. In the press release, Ásmundur stated: “There is no comprehensive legislation on school services for nursery, primary and secondary schools and no central organization with a defined role to implement and coordinate these services. Access to services varies, both between and within school levels and municipalities, which leads to inequality. We need to coordinate the systems to ensure a comprehensive, effective, and quality service such as when students move between schools or move between school levels. We also need greater consultation with school staff and support for school work, allowing for faster and more efficient resources for children and young people. Everything we do should be aimed at their success.” A new organisation will take over the responsibilities of the Directorate of Education. During the transition period, the responsibilities of the Directorate will be placed directly under the Ministry of Education and Childrens’ Affairs.

29,Iceland Review,VR to Remain in ASÍ,2022/10/17,"Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairperson of VR, has stated that for the time being, VR’s position within ASÍ will remain unchanged. VR is Iceland’s largest trade union, representing some 40,000 workers. There have however been suggestions recently that VR will leave ASÍ, or the Federation of Labour. ASÍ, founded in 1916, is the largest federation of trade unions in Iceland and has historically played an important role in labour organisation in Iceland. However, the most recent ASÍ conference over contract negotiations has proved a turbulent one, with many major trade unions suggesting that they go their separate ways in the future. The upheavals come in the wake of Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year from her leadership position in ASÍ. Citing political hostility, she said that it was no longer possible to perform her duties in her resignation letter. Since her resignation, ASÍ leadership has been in turmoil, with some of Iceland’s largest trade unions considering leaving during ASÍ’s 45th conference. Ragnar Þór also withdrew his candidacy for ASÍ leadership at the conference, citing the possibility of a break with the federation. Now, at least for the time being, it seems that VR will remain with ASÍ. The announcement came today before a formal meeting with SA, Iceland’s leading employers’ union. In a statement from Ragnar Þór, he said that all of the union’s efforts will now be directed towards the wage negotiations with SA. Regarding the future, however, Ragnar Þór emphasised that nothing can be ruled out.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
30,Iceland Review,Court Rules City Not Liable for Rabbit Collision,2022/10/15,"The Reykjavík District Court has ruled that the City of Reykjavík does not have to compensate a local cyclist who was injured when running over a rabbit on a municipally maintained cycling path, RÚV reports. The accident occurred in 2016, after a rabbit ran into the path of the man’s bicycle. He ran over the animal, fell off his bike, and careened into a tree. He then had to be hospitalized for ten days to recover from the injuries he sustained. See Also: Rabbit Rescue Hops to Rehome Sixty Wild Bunnies In his suit, the man claimed that the conditions of the cycling path were indefensible, and that the lighting at the scene of the accident was particularly bad. He also maintained that the city had been aware of an ongoing wild rabbit epidemic, as well as an increase in cycling accidents involving the wayward hoppers, but had failed to take any action about this until subsequent media coverage of the issue. In its judgement on the case, the District Court agreed that the city would have been aware of the disturbances that rabbits could cause for cyclists on its paths. However, rabbits are wild mammals and therefore, protected by Icelandic law. “It’s clear that rabbits, like other animals including birds, cats, and rats, can find their way onto the city’s walking and cycling paths,” remarked the court, adding that it would be no easy thing for municipal authorities to prevent such encounters. The court also found that better lighting and/or mirrors on the path would have been unlikely to prevent the accident and the city will not be obligated to pay damages to the cyclist.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

32,Iceland Review,"No Daytime Shelter for Homeless Men, Despite Protests",2022/10/14,"Emergency shelters for homeless men will remain closed during the day, according to the Director of Reykjavík’s Welfare Council. The city will continue to focus on the buildup of more permanent housing resources for the homeless. “We’re literally on the streets, no matter the weather,” one homeless man told Vísir. Yesterday, Vísir.is reported on the numerous homeless women who seek refuge at the Konukot emergency shelter. The shelter is overcrowded most nights, too small to meet demand. In an interview with Vísir, Heiða Björg Hilmisdóttir, Director of Reykjavík’s Welfare Council, stated that the Council was currently completing an appraisal of Konukot to establish whether more space was required. “We’re also considering providing more halfway homes, so that individuals would first be allotted a room where they’re offered necessary support, prior to those individuals moving into dedicated apartments.” Despite the congestion at Konukot, homeless women can seek shelter at Icelandic Church Aid during the day, while homeless men can only seek shelter at Samhjálp between 10 AM and 2 PM. With winter fast approaching, a group of homeless men organised a sit-down strike at an emergency shelter in the Grandi neighbourhood of Reykjavík on Wednesday to protest. Vísir spoke to a few protesters, who voiced their indignation at being turned out of emergency shelters during the day, in all kinds of weather and physical states. Among the protesters was Davíð Þór Jónsson, one of the founders of Viðmót – an organised interest group on the rights of drug users. Davíð was diagnosed with pneumonia last week but has had no choice but to roam the streets in the cold. “Our only refuge during the day is Samhjálp, which is open between 10 AM and 2 PM. After that, we’re literally on the streets, no matter the weather.” Davíð Þór wants homeless men to be offered comparable shelter as Icelandic Church Aid offers women. “There are plenty of talented people who are homeless; something good could be made of their talents if they had appropriate shelter.” Despite such concerns being raised, Heiða Björg Hilmisdóttir told Vísir that the emergency shelters will remain closed during the day: “There are always places of refuge for everyone, but the emergency shelters will not be open. The city libraries are always open. People can sit down, have some coffee, and relax,” Heiða told Vísir, explaining that the city conceives of emergency shelters as temporary resources. “The ideology behind emergency shelters is that you can stay there overnight if you don’t have a place to stay. But it isn’t housing. You don’t live there. This is a temporary option, but we don’t want people to settle down. We haven’t emphasised an increased number of emergency shelters, having chosen to focus on providing more permanent housing.” According to Heiða, the City of Reykjavík has allocated 130 apartments to homeless individuals since the beginning of last year. “Where you can settle down and make a home for yourself, which is not something you can do at an emergency shelter.” According to Vísir, 61 individuals are on a waiting list for housing in Reykjavík. A third of those who seek out emergency shelters are legal residents of other municipalities, which means that they are not eligible to apply for housing in Reykjavík. As noted by Iceland Review, the City of Reykjavík released a report in 2021 that “found 301 people were experiencing homelessness in the city. This is a decrease of 14% since 2017. According to data from the report, 71% of the individuals were men, 29% were women, and most were between 21 and 49 years of age.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
33,Iceland Review,Icelandic to Take Precedence on Keflavík Airport Signage,2022/10/14,"The board of directors at Isavia, the national airport and air navigation service provider of Iceland, has decided to renew the signage at Keflavík Airport so as to emphasise the Icelandic language; Isavia will foreground Icelandic on all instructional and informational signs at the airport. The Icelandic Language Council was established in 1964 and operates according to Article 6 of Law No. 61/2011 regarding the status of the Icelandic language and Icelandic sign language: “The role of the Icelandic Language Council shall be to provide public authorities with academically-informed advice on matters concerning the Icelandic language, and to make proposals to the Minister regarding language policy.” The law also stipulates that the Council may “take the initiative to draw attention to both positive and negative aspects of the ways in which the Icelandic language is used in the public sphere.” With a view to this provision of the law, the Icelandic Language Council has persistently drawn attention to the conspicuously anglicised signage at the Keflavík National Airport: “English is the primary language on almost all of the signs at the airport,” a journalist at RÚV writes, “with information in Icelandic playing a secondary role or none at all.” Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Professor Emeritus at the University of Iceland, brought attention to the issue again after Icelandair announced that it would resume the custom of addressing passengers in Icelandic first, prior to reverting to other languages. Isavia responded with reference to security concerns, but critics pushed back, noting that local languages were foregrounded in many international airports without such a thing being a cause of concern; Gaelic is foregrounded at Irish airports ahead of English. An article on Mbl.is notes that Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Culture and Business Affairs, emphasised these concerns to the Board of Directors of Isavia, the national airport and air navigation service provider of Iceland. According to Mbl.is, Lilja had “commented on the marginalisation of the Icelandic language at the airport at the time before reemphasising her concerns following Icelandair’s decision.” Lilja reached out to former minister Kristján Þór Júlíusson, the newly-elected Chairman of the Board for Isavia, who then raised the issue at a board meeting (see below entry: “Concerns have been raised, and comments made, in public, by, among other parties, the board of the Icelandic Language Council in 2016 and 2017, regarding the use of language on informational and instructional signs at the Keflavík Airport. Isavia’s board discussed these issues in 2018. Over the recent days, criticism has resurfaced. In light of this criticism, Isavia’s board hsa agreed upon the following: ‘Extensive renovations are currently underway at Keflavík Airport. Alongside the current alterations, Isavia’s board of directors has decided to devise a plan to renew the airport’s signage, in phases, in the near future. During this renewal, the principle of ensuring the foregrounding of the Icelandic language on instructional and informational signs will be followed.’”","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
34,Iceland Review,Foreign Nationals to Receive Icelandic Citizenship after Controversial Withholding of Applications,2022/10/13,"RÚV reports that six foreign citizens are to be naturalised as Icelandic citizens following a delay that was caused by the Directorate of Immigration withholding their applications. The six new Icelanders are respectively from Mongolia, Russia, South Africa, Kosovo, and Iran. In addition to the normal process of receiving citizenship through residence and application, parliament can also grant citizenship through decree in Iceland. These special applications are generally for individuals in extenuating circumstances, though some critics such as Bjarni Benediktsson have stated that these special applications constitute too large a proportion of Icelandic naturalisations. These citizenship applications through decree are still processed by the Directorate of Immigration, however, and there was controversy when earlier in the year, the Directorate refused to hand over the relevant application to parliament. Notably, this deliberate withholding was illegal, and caused outcry among politicians who insisted that legal process be followed. Now, the relevant application have finally been submitted and the path has been cleared to Icelandic citizenship for the six.

36,Iceland Review,Never Been More Difficult to Hire Staff: September Unemployment at 2.8%,2022/10/13,"Unemployment rates sat at 2.8% in September, creating tension in the labour market. Although this may sound like a good development, according to the Federation of Trade and Services, hiring new staff has never been more difficult for Icelandic employers. In a statement to RÚV, Landsbankinn economist Una Jónsdóttir said that instead of employees competing for jobs, it is now the case that employers are competing for staff. In total, around 5,400 were unemployed in September, largely representing the retail, service, transportation, and restaurant industries. Of these 5,400, 44% are reported to be foreign residents in Iceland. In comparison with the total unemployment rate for Iceland of 2.8%, the unemployment rate for foreigners is double, at 5.6%. Iceland’s Suðurnes region is notable as having an especially high unemployment rate of 4.8%, with the capital region sitting around 3.2%. Icelandic unemployment is lowest in the Northwest, which has only 0.7%. Economists have suggested that the increased demand for labour created by the low unemployment could affect the upcoming wage negotiations.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

The police no longer believe that the victim’s death was the result of a punishable offence. After a woman was found dead in her car Saturday morning (in the 105 district of Reykjavík, near Laugardalur), two men in their forties were arrested suspected of homicide. The men, both of whom were in their forties, were said to have known the victim. The police withheld details during the initial stages of the investigation, prior to releasing a public statement yesterday evening: “The forensic pathologist has concluded that the woman’s injuries did not lead to her death; there is no longer any reason to believe that the woman’s death was the result of a punishable offence.” The police clarified that during the initial stages of the investigation, the forensic pathologist and the police were confronted with many “questionable aspects” that required further examination. For this reason, two men connected to the woman were arrested, and the police intended to keep them in custody until October 13. But they have now been released.

38,Iceland Review,Domestic Terrorists Targeted Sólveig Jónsdóttir and Gunnar Egilsson,2022/10/10,"The men being held in police custody for planning a domestic terrorism attack in Iceland are reported to have targeted Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir and Gunnar Smári Egilsson, chairperson of the Socialist Party. This was first reported in Samstöðin, a media platform for leftwing political debate. According to Samstöðdin, individuals named by the suspects as potential targets were brought in by the district prosecutor to testify. Sólveig was reportedly shown an exchange in which the suspects vowed to kill her, identifying her as a troublemaker who wanted to start a revolution. Gunnar was also shown a conversation in which one of the suspects reported to have seen Gunnar in a restaurant. The suspect speculated about what would happen if he had killed Gunnar on the spot. Sólveig stated to Samstöðin the following: “[o]f course, it is frightening to learn that these men have been collecting weapons and planning to execute me for my political views and work. But I’ve just become so numb from the relentless attacks and accusations over the past few years that I took it like any other attack.” In response to the planned attacks, Gunnar has highlighted the dangers of rightwing nationalism and hate speech. Gunnar stated to Samstöðin that “[t]he Socialist Party is fighting for the development of social housing, to repeal tax cuts for the rich, for the general public to have power over their resources and other national issues that enjoy the support of a large majority of the public. The right responds to this by associating Socialists with Stalin’s crimes, violence, subversion and plots to deprive people of their freedom.” Gunnar also called attention to the unfair ways in which Sólveig is portrayed in media, with terms such as “purges” regarding her recent reorganization of the Efling union office associating her with Soviet dictatorship.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
39,Iceland Review,Two Men Held in Custody for Murder in Reykjavík,2022/10/10,"Two men are being held in police custody for their suspected involvement in a murder in Reykjavík. According to the initial police report and Morgunblaðið, a woman was found dead in her car Saturday morning in the 105 district of Reykjavík, near Laugardalur. It is not clear how long the woman had been dead in her car until the case was reported, but this question is now under investigation by Reykjavík police. The two men held in custody are in their forties and are said to have known the victim. Because the investigation is still in its initial stage, the police have not provided more details, given the sensitive nature of personal information in such cases. The murder is notable as the fourth murder so far this year in Iceland. Iceland, often cited as one of the safest nations in the world, generally has a low murder rate. This year appears to some as an outlier, with already four murders before year’s end. However, as Icelandic criminologist Dr. Margrét Valdimarsdóttir has noted, such statistics can be somewhat misleading in the case of Iceland. The mean murder incidence between 2001 and 2020 in Iceland sat around two a year. With such small-scale numbers, statistical outliers can also be given too much weight, with an increase of two to four murders representing a 100% increase in murders. Icelandic society has also grown rapidly in recent years, meaning an increase in murders is also inevitable. More details will be reported on the case as it develops.      ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
40,Iceland Review,Multicultural Festival Celebrated as Part of ‘Friendship Week’ in Vopnafjörður,2022/10/09,"The East Iceland village of Vopnafjörður will celebrate its second annual Multicultural Festival on Saturday, with international food, dance exhibitions, games, international cartoons for children, and more. Austurfrétt reports that just under 10% of the fishing village’s population is of foreign extraction, with full-time residents hailing from 20 different countries around the world. As of September, 670 people called Vopnafjörður home. Sixty of these residents are originally from another country. Poles make up the largest subset of foreign residents, followed by Bulgarians. The village is also home to people from Sweden and Pakistan, among other nations. “People have always come here from abroad,” says Þórhildur Sigurðardóttir, who oversees multicultural and diversity initiatives for the larger municipality. Þórhildur explained that the village has a history of attracting foreign workers, but it’s only recently that the makeup of the fulltime population has been so diverse. “There are people with Faroese roots, and then Danish women came to work here. I think one of them is still left. Otherwise, there weren’t many [other nationalities] here even six years ago. For a long time, it was just one woman from Poland. But that’s changed completely.” Vopnafjörður held its first Multicultural Festival in 2020, at which time, there were people from 22 countries living in the village. The following year, a Children’s Cultural Festival was held instead, but still with a multicultural focus. During that festival, kids were taught how to count to five in 13 languages and flags were raised for each of the nationalities living there. This year, the Multicultural Festival is just one part of a week-long ‘Friendship Week,’ sponsored by a local youth club and programmed entirely by teenagers. Friendship Week runs from Friday, October 7 to Sunday, October 16 and will include a variety of events, including a parade, a potluck-style cake buffet, a movie night, a ‘goodwill marathon,’ in which residents are encouraged to do good deeds for one another (such as raking leaves, folding laundry, dog walking, etc), an intergenerational game night, and more.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
41,Iceland Review,Peace Tower Lighting Ceremony Cancelled Due to Weather,2022/10/08,"The annual lighting of the Imagination Peace Tower ceremony on the island of Víðey just off the coast of Reykjavík has been cancelled due to inclement weather. Per an announcement on the City of Reykjavík’s website, Sunday’s planned celebrations have been called off due to wind warnings in Faxaflói Bay, where Víðey is located. The Imagine Peace Tower is an outdoor artwork by Yoko Ono in memory of her late husband, John Lennon. The white stone monument emits a tower of light, which extends upward at least 4,000 metres (13,100 feet) on a clear night. The words “Imagine Peace” are inscribed on the monument in 24 languages. The tower is lit every year from October 9th, Lennon’s birthday, through December 8th, the date of his assassination. It has been lit every year since 2007. Lighting will be livestreamed  Typically, free ferries transport guests to Víðey on the evening of the lighting to observe the ceremony and participate in a variety of activities, from live music performances to guided history walks around the island. Although the in-person ceremony has been cancelled this year, the tower will still be lit as usual, at 8:00PM local time. The lighting will be broadcast live on the Imagine Peace Tower website and RÚV’s television and radio schedule on Sunday evening will include a number of related content, such as a TV segment on the history of the tower, and a radio documentary about the life of John Lennon.

42,Iceland Review,Judge Grants Extended Custody Over Domestic-Terror Suspects,2022/10/07,"Yesterday, the Reykjavík District Court granted the district attorney’s request to extend custody over two individuals suspected of planning a domestic-terror attack, both of whom have been kept in isolation since late September, RÚV reports. The suspects’ lawyers have appealed the decision to the National Court. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, all of whom are in their twenties, had reportedly discussed carrying out an attack during the police’s annual celebration (which was held on October 1). Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson told reporters that this was the “first investigation of its kind to be launched in Iceland.” Yesterday, District Attorney Ólafur Þór Hauksson confirmed to RÚV that the Reykjavík District Court had agreed to extend custody over the two suspects. The court’s rationale was primarily founded on the complicated nature of the investigation. As previously noted, eight different units are working on the investigation. “We’re investigating the 3D printer, various electronic data, weapons, and tips from the public. We’ve also sent quite a bit of data to police authorities in the Nordic countries and to Europol so that they may assist in our processing of the evidence,” Grímur Grímsson, Chief of the Capital Area Police, told reports on September 29. According to Ólafur Þór, the police have also yet to formally interrogate the two suspects. As soon as investigative interests no longer apply, however, there would be no need to keep the suspects isolated, Ólafur observed. The suspects’ lawyers have criticised their clients’ prolonged isolation. They appealed the decision to extend custody to the National Court yesterday. As previously noted in Iceland Review, National Police Commissioner Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir has recused herself from the investigation, as the home of the Police Commissioner’s father, a well-known weapons collector, was searched during the investigation.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
43,Iceland Review,#MeToo “Revolution” Within Icelandic Secondary Schools,2022/10/07,"This week, students at MH junior college protested a history of perceived inaction on behalf of school administrators in matters of sexual abuse and misconduct. During a staged walk-out, students called on administrators and government officials to take action. In addition to offering formal apologies, school administrators, alongside one government minister, took steps to rectify the state of affairs in the future. Tuesday, October 3, was a day of protest at the Hamrahlíð Junior College (Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð) in Reykjavík. Rhetorical questions were smeared on bathroom mirrors with lipstick: “Why are there so many rapists?” School administrators were addressed via typed-out messages hung in the hallways: “As a student at MH, I refuse to accept that full-on rapists are sitting across from me in class, are participating in group projects – are passing me by in the halls.” The source of these protests? The perception that history was repeating itself at MH: that once again school administrators were handling accusations of sexual abuse passively – and that victims were being made to confront perpetrators in the halls. “For fuck’s sake, do something. I refuse to attend the same school as a person charged with raping his little cousin.” In an op-ed published on Vísir.is on the following morning, MH alumna Brynhildur Karlsdóttir delineated her experience at MH junior college ten years ago: “When I was a 17-year-old student at MH, I was raped by my friend and schoolmate. When I finally mustered the courage to open up to school administrators – I was met with closed doors. Despite anxiety attacks, fear, and post-traumatic stress, I never reported the incident to the police, and the only solace that the administration could offer was the prospect of switching schools.” Brynhildur’s best friend waged a similar war: “Having been brutally raped, my friend Elísabet pressed charges and offered substantial evidence. Nonetheless, she was made to confront her rapist in the hallways and attend the same classes. There was no justice for Elísabet, no one looked out for her, and she alone was made to shoulder responsibility for the violence she suffered. She committed suicide in 2019.” Later in her piece, Brynhildur weaves her narrative into contemporary events at MH, describing how a student, as mentioned above, had decided to take matters into her own hands, writing lipstick messages onto bathroom mirrors. “I know this because my sister and my sister-in-law attend MH, and they tell me of a kind of student revolution that’s taking place.” Speaking to a journalist from Vísir, Brynhildur described the administration’s reaction to the protests vicariously, through her sister and sister-in-law: “They said that the administration had been rather upset, and referred to the protests a kind of ‘group hysteria.’ They don’t seem to be showing any consideration for the experiences of students, who are opening up about the injustice that they’ve suffered. It’s just silenced, and, once again, the shame lives on with the victims.” The President of MH, Steinn Jóhannsson, reached out to Brynhildur on the following morning, offering an apology on the school’s behalf (despite not having been President during Brynhildur’s time at the college): “He offered a former apology on behalf of MH … it was unexpected,” Brynhildur remarked. “One is somehow not used to someone accepting responsibility and saying, ‘Yes, that’s awful, we’re so sorry to hear it, and we failed you.’ That was big.” MH administrators also offered a formal apology to students, observing that they regretted the fact that current and former students had experienced distress relating to matters of sexual abuse and misconduct within the school premises. “These are sensitive issues; we want to learn and do better,” a press release from the school read. At 11 AM yesterday morning, dozens of MH students staged a walk-out, congregating outside the walls of the school in a meeting of solidarity and to voice their demands. Other students from other secondary schools also attended. Agla Elín Davíðsdóttir, a student at MH, read a list of demands geared toward changing school contingency plans regarding matters of sexual abuse. “We demand that administrators treat sexual offences with the same, if not greater, gravity as other violent offences,” Agla stated. As noted by RÚV, the protestors made four demands: Among those who attended the protests was Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Education and Children. When asked why he had decided to attend the protests, Ásmundur remarked that the students were calling for the government and school administrators to listen. “And that’s why I’m here … I think that for too long we’ve failed to engage with these voices … these young people, they’re heralding a new era, and if we fail to listen – we’re in trouble.” Addressing the crowd, Ásmundur offered an apology on behalf of the Icelandic government: “We apologise for not having listened to you over the past years,” he stated. Aside from the apologies, the upshot of the protests was also more concrete: school administrators from MH held a meeting with the Association of Icelandic Secondary School Students (SÍF) and decided that the school would partner with the association in its efforts against sexual violence and harassment. Minister Ásmundur Einar has also stated that he would call a meeting with the headmasters of Icelandic secondary schools to review contingency plans.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
44,Iceland Review,Hopes for New ASÍ Leadership Amidst Contract Negotiations,2022/10/06,"With many labour contracts expiring at the end of October, pressure is mounting on the current round of negotiations. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, acting chairman of ASÍ after Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year, has stated that a major issue at ASÍ’s upcoming conference will of course be wage increases, but that choosing new leadership will play an equally important role. Drífa’s departure earlier this year caused some turmoil within ASÍ leadership, which Kristján states has unfortunately turned the energies of the association towards inward power struggles, not outward to the wage negotiations. So far, VR president Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson is the only one to announce their candidacy for ASÍ president, but there still remains the opportunity for individuals to announce their candidacy at the conference. Another debated issue in the current negotiations is the role of the state mediator. Kristján is on record calling for a simplified process by which unions can call for strikes, giving them relatively more power at the bargaining table. Notably, many other trade unions in the Nordic nations also allow for leadership to call unilaterally for a strike, circumventing the need for union-wide votes. Kristján has called for such reforms to the strike process in lieu of strengthening the role of the state mediator. The wage negotiations take place against the backdrop of an ever-rising cost of living in Iceland. Main contributing factors include inflation and rising interest rates that have seen mortgage payments increase significantly this year. Yesterday, the Central Bank announced a .25% increase to the interest rate. Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the Central Bank, warned that the course of inflation in Iceland was largely up to the labour market. The rate increase could be interpreted as an attempt to dissuade negotiators from too-ambitious of wage increases, as they may drive inflation further.  ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
45,Iceland Review,Policy Aims to Promote Transparency in Iceland’s Fishing Industry,2022/10/06,"A new government initiative spearheaded by Svandís Svavarsdóttir, head of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, aims to bring comprehensive policy reforms and transparency to the fishing industry. The initiative, entitled Auðlindin Okkar (Our Resource), arose out of several working groups that were commissioned earlier in the year in line with the Agreement on the Platform for the Coalition Government between the Independence Party, the Left Green Movement, and the Progressive Party. In the coalition charter, it states the following regarding fisheries: “A committee will be appointed to map the challenges and opportunities in fisheries and related sectors and to assess the macroeconomic benefits of the fisheries management system. The committee will be tasked with comparing the situation in Iceland and abroad and submitting proposals to maximise Icelanders’ potential for further success and societal consensus on the framework of the sector. The committee will also discuss how transparency in fisheries companies’ operations can be increased, especially among the country’s largest companies. In addition, the committee will evaluate the success of employment and regional quotas and summer inshore handline fishing in supporting the rural economy.” In the estimation of these working groups, the time has come for a new approach. Earlier this year, Svandís stated that “there is a deep feeling of injustice among the public […] I think that feeling stems mainly from two things; the consolidation of quota and the feeling that the profits from the shared resource of the people are not divided fairly. The aim of this work is therefore efficient and sustainable utilisation of marine resources in harmony with the environment and society.” Now, Our Resource aims to shine daylight on a very powerful sector of the Icelandic economy that some say borders on oligarchy. There are, for instance, just four companies that collectively own 60% of all Iceland’s fishing quota: Samherji, Brim, KS, and Ísfélagið. A central aim of the initiative will be a thorough mapping of the management and ownership of Iceland’s major fishing concerns. Many details of the property relations in these concerns remain in the dark, and Our Resource hopes to be able to better supervise the industry. According to the government website, “[t]he inspection is primarily intended to increase transparency and improve administration in the field of monitoring management and ownership relationships in the maritime industry. The examination includes the collection of information and the mapping of the property relationships of fishing companies that have been allocated a certain amount of fishing permits and the influence of fishing company owners through the exercise of voting rights and board seats in companies.” This initial mapping report on the industry is to be published by December 31, 2022.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
46,Iceland Review,Key Interest Rates Increased .25%,2022/10/05,"Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Icelandic Central Bank, announced today in a presentation that key interest rates would be raised again by .25%. Now sitting at 5.75% for seven-day term deposits, the interest rate is a its highest level since 2016. Interest rates have risen sharply in recent months to combat inflation, which peaked at 9.9% in July of this year. It has since dropped to 9.3%, still well above the Central Bank’s target of 2.5%. In the announcement on the Central Bank’s website, it states that “indicators suggest that recent interest rate hikes have slowed overall demand growth and housing market activity. Headline inflation measured 9.3% in September and has fallen by 0.6 percentage points since the MPC’s August meeting. Underlying inflation rose between meetings, however. There are also signs that inflation expectations have begun to decline again, although they are still above the Bank’s inflation target.” For the first half of 2022, GDP grew at a strong rate of 6.8%, but slowdowns are expected in the winter months. The announcement also states that “the global economic outlook has deteriorated and uncertainty has grown, which could cause domestic demand to ease more quickly than previously assumed.” The Central Bank remains hopeful that inflation can be brought back down to acceptable levels within a reasonable timeframe, but stresses that many of the decisions driving inflation will be made at the corporate level, in the labour market, and in public sector finances.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

RÚV reports that three hundred people took part in the exercise. Drills of this magnitude are held at every international airport every four years. These drills are extremely important for emergency responders, says Árni Birgisson, coordinator of airports and aviation security for Isavia. “Fortunately, flying is our safest form of travel, so our readiness is very seldom put to the test other than through these exercises.” To ensure that responders are prepared for every eventuality, considerable effort is put into making the drills as realistic as possible. The scene on Saturday was a dramatic one, with thick black smoke wafting over the site of the drill. According to the staged scenario, an airplane was supposed to have skidded off the runway during landing and collided with a stationary plane. This crash would have caused one of the planes to burst into flame and resulted in the death or serious injury of dozens of people. Volunteers playing victims in the drill were, therefore, posed in various states of distress along the runway so that responders would have to act fast and prioritize the injured, even as the plane continued to burn.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
51,Iceland Review,"New Birthing Centre Aims to Innovate, Empower",2022/10/01,"A new birthing centre has opened in the capital, Vísir reports. Owned and operated by midwives Embla Ýr Guðmundsdóttir and Emma Marie Swift, the Reykjavík Birthing Centre is a reincarnation of a former birthing centre with the same name, which ceased its operations three decades ago. Located in the new neighborhood of Hlíðarendi, the Reykjavík Birthing Centre has been open for patient consultation and facility visits for several weeks. On Wednesday, the National Medical Examiner approved the Centre to begin its operations in earnest. It employs four midwives, all of whom have different specialties, and dozens of women are planning to give birth there in the coming months. Emma Marie and Embla Ýr estimate that in the beginning, they will be able to assist ten women a month, although there’s always the possibility they will hire more midwives and expand their facilities in the future, if all goes well. Focus on continuous care The Centre aims to give parents more options when planning their births. And given that their services are subsidized by Icelandic national health insurance, the cost to expectant parents is comparable to what they’d find at, for instance, the National University Hospital. Continuous care is the guiding philosophy at the Centre. “It’s about the midwife accompanying a woman and her family through the pregnancy and birthing process and then for the first ten days after the birth,” says Embla Ýr. The Centre also aims to create a homely environment and parents-to-be are encouraged to visit the facilities and beforehand, to make for a more comfortable birthing experience. Both Embla Ýr and Emma Marie teach at the University of Iceland and advocate for this style of maternity care in their classes. “We wanted to let the work speak for itself instead of just talking about this style of service and its impact. We wanted to create a place that would give us an opportunity to work in this way,” says Embla Ýr. Trilingual service for increased accessibility The Centre has two birthing rooms, as well as consultation rooms and a large hall in which various classes, such as yoga and pregnancy counseling, are held. The courses are taught in three languages—Icelandic, English, and Polish—for increased accessibility. “We wanted to bring everything together under one roof where the people who come here can be absolutely certain that everything’s being done according to the same philosophy,” says Emma. “That is, to empower, to support natural births, and to support continuous service in such an expanded way.” Preserving a legacy, but still seeking to innovate The original Reykjavík Maternity Centre operated on the corner of Þorfinnsgata and Eiríksgata from 1960 to 1992. Emma Marie and Embla Ýr spoke to women who had been patients at the original Centre before opening, and Emma says that most of them had fond memories of it and were eager to see its legacy preserved. And both Emma Marie and Embla Ýr are committed to being just as innovative in the services they offer to their patients today as the original founders were in their own time. “A lot of things we take for granted today started there and that’s maybe what we’re gesturing at by keeping the name—that we want to be a similar place,” says Emma Marie.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
52,Iceland Review,139 Fin Whales Hunted During Whaling Season,2022/09/30,"Five fin whales were hunted this week and towed into Hvalfjörður fjord. A total of 139 whales were caught this whaling season by the company Hvalur hf, Mbl.is reports. As reported by Iceland Review earlier this year, two whaling ships owned by the company Hvalur hf. set off from Reykjavík harbour on June 22 this summer to begin the whaling season. No commercial whaling had taken place in Iceland for four years (although a single minke whale was hunted in 2021.) By the start of September, 100 fin whales had been caught. Four weeks later, after a spell of fine weather, 39 additional whales had been hunted – with five of those being towed into Hvalfjörður fjord this week. “What’s noteworthy this time around,” Elín B. Ragnarsdóttir, Division Head of Fishing Supervision with the Directorate of Fisheries, told Mbl.is, “is that inspectors from the Directorate of Fisheries have been aboard all whaling ships since August 24 and have supervised the hunting of fin whales on behalf of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST). Until August 24, inspectors were on board the whaling ships and supervised the hunting of about 15% of the whales.” When asked if any complaints had been filed on behalf of the Directorate of Fisheries, Elín gestured towards MAST: “The supervision that is carried out today is largely in the hands of the Food and Veterinary Authority, given that animal-welfare issues fall within their purview. A summary of the Directorate of Fisheries’ supervision is being prepared but is not ready for publication.” Whaling season usually concludes at the end of September (although it depends on the weather). Earlier this year, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated she saw little reason to permit whaling after Hvalur hf.’s current licence expires in 2023. In an op-ed published in the Morgunblaðið newspaper, Svandís wrote that there was little evidence that whaling was economically beneficial to Iceland. She also noted that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. The minister concluded by saying that the government would carry out an assessment on the potential economic and social impact of whaling this year.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
53,Iceland Review,"Artist and Musician Prins Póló Passes Away, Aged 45",2022/09/30,"Icelandic musician Svavar Pétur Eysteinsson, better known as Prins Póló, has passed away at the age of 45. Svavar was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2018. “Rest in peace, genius and friend,” music critic Arnar Eggert Thoroddsen wrote in remembrance of musician Svavar Pétur Eysteinsson (better known as Prins Póló) who passed away yesterday at the age of 45 after a four-year battle with cancer. He continued: “Your contribution to Icelandic art is immeasurable, and your name will live forever, just watch. Your fertile ideas, your inclination to buck trends, to just DO, never to overthink things, to be constantly doing – with death itself on your back in the end … Icelandic art – and Icelandic music in particular – has been greatly impoverished.” Svavar Pétur Eysteinsson founded the alternative rock band Skakkamanage in the mid-2000s. The band would go on to release three albums: Lab of Love in 2006, All Over The Face in 2008, and Sounds of Merrymaking in 2014. Svavar Pétur was also a part of the bands Rúnk and Múldýrið. Svavar began releasing albums under the name Prins Póló in 2010 (Prinspóló initially) with his debut album Jukk. The single Niðrá Strönd enjoyed great popularity and was, among other things, featured in an episode of This American Life in 2013. Prins Póló released París Norðursins, a single from the eponymous album in 2014, which became something of an anthem. Iceland Review’s Jelena Ćirić interviewed Svavar Pétur last year. Speaking to Jelena, Svavar tried to shed light on the personal tensions that governed his art: “There’s an imp on my right shoulder that’s always saying: ‘Be wise, do something practical.’ Then there’s one on my left shoulder that just goes ‘bleeehhh!’ Then they talk to each other and somehow it works out.” Svavar had three children with his wife Berglind Häsler.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
54,Iceland Review,Semi-Automatic Weapons Seized During Domestic-Terror Plot Raid,2022/09/29,"Last week, the police arrested four Icelandic men suspected of planning a domestic-terrorism attack. During a press conference today, the police stated that numerous weapons, including semi-automatic firearms and 3D-printed components, had been seized during the investigation. Two of the suspects remain in custody and are being held in isolation. Four Icelandic men were arrested last Wednesday, September 21, suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, all of whom are in their twenties, had discussed carrying out an attack during the police’s annual celebration (to be held on Saturday, October 1). Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson told reporters last week that this was the “first investigation of its kind to be launched in Iceland.” At 3 PM today, the police authorities held another press conference to update the public on the state of the investigation. Taking their places behind their respective podia, Grímur Grímsson, Chief of the Capital Area Police, and Sveinn Ingiberg Magnússon, Chief of Police for the District Attorney’s Office, began by revealing that the National Police Commissioner, Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir, had recused herself from the investigation as an individual connected to her had been named in the investigation. According to Grímur, the police have executed 17 search warrants and seized numerous firearms, some of which had been assembled with 3D-printed components and others that had been modified to function as automatic weapons. The authorities have also seized magazines, bullets, silencers, and knives. Nevertheless, Grímur observed, the threat of a terrorist attack in Iceland “remains low“ and the police have seen no reason to raise the alert level: “There’s no reason to believe that we, as a society, are not safe,” Grímur remarked. Grímur also noted that the investigation was complicated and time consuming: “We have eight different units working on the investigation. We’re investigating the 3D printer, various electronic data, weapons, and tips from the public. We’ve also sent quite a bit of data to police authorities in the Nordic countries and to Europol so that they may assist in our processing of the evidence.” After the press conference, Grímur and Sveinn fielded a few questions, most of which were deflected on the grounds that the police could “not comment during this stage of the investigation.” It was revealed, however, that the two suspects are being held in isolation and that the police had arrested them less than 24 hours after suspicions of a domestic terrorism attack had emerged. Grímur and Sveinn concluded the press conference by encouraging the public to report any suspicion of 3D-printed firearms or ammunition to the police.

55,Iceland Review,Rising Prices Likely to Affect Christmas Book Market,2022/09/28,"Inflation and the energy crisis in Europe are driving up prices for many consumer goods, and Christmas books are likely to be no exception this year. Books are a traditional and popular Christmas gift in Iceland, so much so that the months preceding Christmas see a “jólabókaflóð,” or flood of Christmas books. The tradition is said to have originated during the Second World War, when products from Europe became scarcer. Books were largely printed locally and were seen as cheap and easily available Christmas gifts. In a statement to RÚV, chairman of the Association of Icelandic Book Publishers Heiðar Ingi Svansson stated that the industry hopes to avoid price increases as much as possible, but that some increases will be inevitable. Heiðar outlined the factors contributing to rising costs: “the main ones are that the energy crisis in Europe is causing an increase in energy prices for the production of paper. In recent years, the supply of paper for book printing has also decreased due to the greater focus of paper manufacturers on producing paper for packaging production, due to the increase in online sales.” Despite the energy crisis and rising costs, Heiðar says that the Icelandic publishing industry must still largely rely on Northern Europe for its needs. “The increase in transportation costs around the world and the fact that the state’s reimbursement of part of the production costs is limited to printing in Europe means that it is not possible for publishers to print books elsewhere in the world,” Heiðar stated. “Also, environmental considerations, including the carbon footprint, play a major role.” Another factor keeping Icelandic publishing in Europe, and especially Germany, is the increasing time frame for printing books. Years ago, when paper was cheaper, publishers kept large stocks of paper. Now with increasing shift in logistics to “just in time” manufacturing, publishers tend to keep increasingly small stocks of paper, meaning that supplies have to be specially ordered for each print run. This means increased time between when the book is sent off to print and when it hits shelves. As a result of this, Icelandic book publishers are keen to keep the printing process as close to Iceland as possible to ensure on-time delivery. Despite the bleak holiday forecast, Heiðar stated that “we are going to do everything in our power to hold back price increases on books before Christmas. The Christmas book is by far the most popular Christmas gift for Icelanders, and we plan to do everything we can to ensure that it remains so.”  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
56,Iceland Review,"New Bus Fare As Of This Saturday, Including 12.5% Hike",2022/09/28,"This Saturday, October 1, the new bus fare will be in effect. The fare will be raised 12.5% across the board, applying to both single tickets and monthly passes. In the announcement, Strætó indicates that the fare has remained unchanged for some time. However, operational costs have also risen sharply recently, including 40% increases in oil prices. Strætó also claims to be especially impacted by shorter working hours in the workforce, which have resulted in operational budget deficits. The price hike is intended to minimize further “optimization” of routes in the capital region. Despite the fare hike, Strætó emphasizes in the announcement that with plans to have a carbon-free bus fleet by 2030, Iceland will be insulated from future fluctuations in oil prices. The new pricing structure, which was approved September 16, is listed on Strætó’s website as follows:  ","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
57,Iceland Review,New Grímsey Church Hosts First Service After Fire,2022/09/27,"The first service was celebrated in the new Grímsey church this Sunday, in a major milestone for the reconstruction. The historic church, built out of driftwood in 1867 and relocated in 1932, burned to the ground last year in a fire. Although no one was injured, the destruction of the church was a significant loss for the small community. The new church has been designed to reference the historical structure, but also to accommodate the modern needs of the community, including use as an event space for the Grímsey islanders. In an interview with RÚV, Reverend Oddur Bjarni Þorkelsson, parish priest of Grímsey said: “It’s a huge moment. I am not often speechless, but that’s exactly how it was. This is the first time I’ve seen the building after its construction began. It’s so similar to the old church but completely different too. And to see the power of the community and the joy of everyone who came to help, this is a great moment.” The reconstruction of the church has cost an estimated ISK 120 million, with the original structure being insured for ISK 30 million. Another ISK 20 million has been funded by the state, but much of the remaining amount has had to be collected by the community themselves.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

Health care professionals state that some 30,000 in the capital are eligible for this newest round, and expect up to 4,000 per day. Similar services are also being provided outside of the capital region. The current round of vaccinations will run until October 7, every weekday between 11am and 3pm. In April of this year, individuals 80 and over were offered their fourth shot. With much of this demographic covered, it is hoped to increase protection for other vulnerable segments of the population. Ragnheiður Ósk Erlendsdóttir, director of nursing in the Capital Region Healthcare System, stated to Vísir that this round of vaccinations will have a slightly different format than before, with both the booster vaccine and also influenza vaccine offered. “People can come here and kill two birds with one stone, get both or one of them depending on what suits them,” she said. “We are going to have three booths, one will only be influenza and one will only be COVID-19, and then there will be one booth that will be both.” According to the latest statistics from covid.is, 78% of the population is considered fully vaccinated, and 27,644 individuals have received their fourth dose of the vaccine.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
59,Iceland Review,Power Outage for Half of Iceland Over Weekend,2022/09/26,"Yesterday, September 25, half of Iceland was without power due an outage whose cause still remains unknown. Areas of Iceland affected include from Blönduós to Höfn, the entirety of northern and eastern Iceland. Such a widespread power outage is nearly unprecedented. The power outage began around noon yesterday and is said to have last two hours in most regions and up to three in others. A public Facebook announcement by Landsnet regarding the outages can be seen below. The power outage was caused by a disruption to the Fljótsdal line, which runs from the Alcoa aluminum smelter to Kárahnjúkavirkjun. The cause of the damage is not known at this time. In a statement to RÚV, Steinunn Þorsteinsdóttir, information officer at Landsnet, stated that the Fljótsdal line created a chain reaction, resulting in the widespread outages. “It’s not very often we have nearly half the country without power at once,” she said. Alcoa aluminum smelter is also reported to have been offline during the outages. “At this stage, we don’t know exactly what happened,” Steinunn said. “Our priority was to bring the electricity back to the area. Now that it’s back on, it’s time to take a look at what happened.”","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
60,Iceland Review,Iceland: Terrorist Plot Sparks Debate on Police Power,2022/09/23,"Icelandic police arrested four men in their twenties this week who are suspected of plotting a terrorist attack on state institutions, possibly including the Icelandic parliament and police force. While the police managed to arrest the men before they could carry out their alleged plan, the incident has sparked a debate on whether the Icelandic police force is adequately equipped for responding to such incidents, and whether the legal framework they operate in is adequate. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated he collaborating with the National Police Commissioner to draft suggestions for reform within the police force. “We are considering publishing these suggestions this autumn,” Jón told Fréttablaðið. “The state of organised crime is more serious than people realise.” While Jón stated that increasing police weaponry could potentially be included in those suggestions, he added that does not mean arming ordinary law enforcement officers with firearms. Ordinary policemen in Iceland don’t carry guns on their person, although there is a gun stored in every police car. The special forces, which do carry firearms, are called out for incidents involving weapons, and their call-outs have increased in number recently. Read More: Does Iceland Have a Gun Problem? Fjölnir Sæmundsson, chairman of the National Association of Police Officers (Landssamband lögreglumanna) stated that while the incident shocked police officers, he is not of the opinion that it indicates a need to arm ordinary police officers in Iceland. The incident does, however, demonstrate the necessity of collaborating with police departments abroad and perhaps reviewing regulations on the permissions Icelandic police have to monitor certain individuals, according to Fjölnir. Asked whether Iceland, like other Nordic countries, is experiencing a rise in the activities of extremist alt-right groups, National Police Commissioner Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir stated that the risk of crime connected to such groups is still considered low. Sigríður stated that the risk assessment for terrorist incidents would not be changed in light of this one incident. Recent incidents involving weapons in Iceland contain one commonality: those involved are young, Icelandic males. Professor of Criminology Helgi Gunnlaugsson told Iceland Review he believes this should be studied. “It’s important to look at the ideology. These young Icelandic males think carrying these weapons around is important and they are prepared to use them. We need to study what’s happening with young males that are on the margins of society.” Helgi suggested that within the Icelandic system, there is more emphasis on responding to crime instead of trying to prevent it. “You have the police, but it would also be helpful to have other types of agencies approaching troubled youth in a constructive way.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
61,Iceland Review,Police Staff Party Was Possible Target of Would-Be Terrorists,2022/09/23,"Four Icelandic men, arrested for plotting an act of terrorism against state institutions, may have been targeting a police staff party that was planned for October 1. This according to the sources of mbl.is. While police are investigating whether the men are connected to alt-right groups, the representatives of Neo-Nazi group Norðurvígi have denied that they have any connection to the four men. The four men, who were arrested on Wednesday, September 21, were all in their twenties. In a press conference yesterday, Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson stated that this was the first investigation of its kind in Iceland. Police also stated it was safe to assume either parliament or the police themselves may have been targets for the planned terrorist act. Neo-Nazi group Norðurvígi (the Icelandic branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement) sent a statement to media following coverage of the arrests that denied their members were involved in planning terrorist acts. “We at the Nordic Resistance Movement want to immediately issue a statement following the discussion in the media that we are NOT connected to any extremist groups and do NOT have people in our ranks who intend to commit acts of terrorism,” the statement reads, in part.

62,Iceland Review,Four Arrested for Intended Domestic Terrorism,2022/09/22,"Four Icelandic men were arrested yesterday, September 21, for terroristic plots against state institutions and civilians. In the press conference which took place at 3pm today, the police have stated it is safe to assume either parliament or the police themselves may have been targets. The police have so far not been forthcoming with details of the arrests. Stundin reports that the suspects are men in their twenties and were found to have hoarded a number of weapons, including dozens of semiautomatic guns and large amounts of ammunition. Nine houses are reported to have been searched. Semiautomatic weapons are considered especially deadly, as they can hold high-capacity magazines. According to Stundin, the suspects may be connected to other international organizations under investigation by the police. At the press conference, Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson stated, “It’s safe to say that our society is safer than it was before.” He continued: “This is the first investigation of its kind to be launched in Iceland. Of course, we don’t want to reveal what the exact police response was. But at the height of the operation, 50 police personnel took part.” The case is still developing, but as Stundin notes, acts of terrorism can carry a maximum sentence of  life imprisonment in Iceland. In addition to violent terroristic acts, financing terrorism can carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, and inciting terroristic acts can carry a maximum sentence of 6 years. The men are also suspected of having 3D-printed components of the firearms in question. This is a developing story and details are subject to change.

64,Iceland Review,"Possible Changes to Car Rentals, Including Limits on Mileage and Age",2022/09/22,"Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir stated in an interview yesterday with RÚV that changes may be coming for the rental car industry in Iceland. The statement came in response to the Ministry of Tourism’s efforts to improve education for foreign drivers on Icelandic roads following the tragic 2018 accident by Núpsvötn, in which three British citizens died. Iceland’s unique landscape is of course a major driver of the tourism industry, but many foreign tourists may not be prepared for the road conditions in Iceland. The car in involved in the Núpsvötn accident had been driven some 340,00km and was 12 years old. Now, politicians and members of the tourism industry are reconsidering what regulations should apply to rental cars to prevent future accidents. “We will refer this to a working group within the ministry that has been working to promote increased security for tourists in this country. We will use this terrible incident to improve regulations and possible legislation to ensure further safety in this country,” Lilja stated to RÚV. Hendrik Berndsen, chairman of Hertz in Iceland and chairman of the Tourism Association’s Car Rental Committee, also expressed the need for better regulation in the rental car industry. The Tourism Association is responsible for 90% of Iceland’s 24,000 rental cars. Speaking to RÚV, he called for a limit of 200,000km for rental cars, and a possible limit of 6-8 years. “It may not be possible to directly blame the car,” he said,  “but is very important that there are the latest cars for drivers who come to the country.”","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
65,Iceland Review,Polish Deputy Minister: Support Language Learning in Both Nations,2022/09/22,"While on an official visit to Iceland, Polish deputy minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek voiced his approval for mutual language learning in both nations. According to the deputy minister, Polish children should be able to learn their mother tongue in Iceland, but Icelandic should also be offered at a university level in Poland. Poles constitute a large portion of the immigrant population in Iceland. According to Statistics Iceland, some 20,500 Poles claimed residency in Iceland in 2021, comprising nearly 40% of the immigrant population and over 5% of the total population. As such, Poland and Iceland have a very important relationship. There are, however, fears that not all Polish immigrants have had the opportunity to properly integrate into Icelandic society. Increased language education in both countries could be a way to better integrate Polish immigrants into Icelandic society. In a public address, the deputy minister stated that Icelandic was already offered at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and that there were plans to extend Icelandic education to the University of Gdańsk. “It’s one of the things we’ve done to show that we take our relationship with Iceland very seriously,” he stated. Mr. Szynkowski vel Sek also noted the need for more Polish-Icelandic translators, saying that as the connection between the two nations has become so significant, it is important to have specialists with good command of both languages.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
66,Iceland Review,Court Denies Erla’s Request for Retrial,2022/09/21,"In a decision handed down September 14, Erla Bolladóttir’s request for a retrial was denied. The court cited a lack of new developments in the case, and ordered Erla to pay some ISK 3 million in fees. Convicted in 1980 in the notorious Guðmundur and Geirfinnur case, Erla has since fought for a retrial. Now, with her appeal rejected, she suggested at a press conference held Wednesday, September 21, that she may appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. “The condition for applying to the Human Rights Court is that you have exhausted all domestic means,” Erla said at the press conference. “This judgment of the court is the final word in this country, so it is definitely something I will consider.” Erla also stated that she intended to pursue her fight for justice, saying that she was recently diagnosed with cancer: “Does anyone think I’m going to spend my last days lying to the world about this injustice?” The Guðmundur and Geirfinnur case is one of the most controversial and notorious criminal cases in Iceland’s modern history, revolving around the disappearance of two young men, Guðmundur and Geirfinnur, in 1974. Six individuals were ultimately convicted in connection to the case, but the extreme interrogation measures taken by the police, including sleep deprivation, drugs, and water torture, have caused many to question the legitimacy of the confessions. The convicts have previously stated that they signed the confessions in order to put an end to their solitary confinements, which, in Erla’s case, was for 242 days. The case has been described as one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in Europe by foreign media. In 2018, a retrial of the case led to five acquittals, though this notably did not apply to Erla who was also charged with perjury in the case. At the time of writing, around 1,100 have signed a petition in support of Erla’s retrial.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
67,Iceland Review,"Housing Prices Drop, Indicating Potential Cooling of Market",2022/09/21,"A recent report by the Housing and Civil Engineering Agency may indicate a cooling in Iceland’s housing market. According to the report, the housing price index has fallen by some 0.4 per cent since last month. Although the change is a relatively humble one, the housing index has not decreased on a month-by-month basis since 2019. Forecasts predicted a cooling in the housing market, given the recent hike in interest rates. Currently sitting around 7 per cent, the interest rate hike was in response to recent inflation, with the goal of de-incentivizing borrowing to cool off markets. The measures seem to be having an effect, although the high interest rates have made the Icelandic housing market especially difficult to enter for first-time home buyers. Una Jónsdóttir, director of Landsbanki’s financial department, stated in an interview with RÚV that “this means that we can fully expect inflation to subside faster than we had originally assumed. Inflation has become very high and housing is one of its main drivers. So a sign of cooling in the real estate market will mean that inflation will go down faster.” Additional tightening of lending rules has also contributed to the contraction. “It is quite likely that key interest rates will continue to rise,” continued Una, “because we are nevertheless seeing very high inflation. Although there are some clear signs that the real estate market is starting to cool down, the underlying inflationary pressure remains very high. We have to try to get inflation down properly, and in order for that to be possible, interest rates definitely have to be raised somewhat further. We are at well over nine per cent inflation right now for the next few months, and the Central Bank’s inflation target is two-and-a-half per cent.” Shown above is the average purchase price for an apartment in the capital region. This year alone has seen explosive growth, with prices rising in excess of ten per cent compared to last year. Nevertheless, Una cautions patience for those who bought at the peak, stating that home-buyers have little to fear: “It’s only one month and it’s not a huge drop. Housing prices have risen a lot and are still quite high. So I don’t think this should have any major impact on those parties,” she said.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
68,Iceland Review,Garden Thieves Undermine Research Project in Elliðaárdalur,2022/09/21,"Recent thefts from a research garden have set back horticultural research by several years, reports RÚV. ALDIN is a planned biodome project to be opened in Elliðaárdalur, a nature area near Reykjavík. The biodome will use green energy to create a carbon-neutral greenhouse that aims to be not just a horticultural and educational centre, but also a restaurant, yoga retreat, and event centre. In addition to the ambitious biodome project, ALDIN also has special research gardens in Elliðaárdalur, where the suitability of different species of foreign and exotic plants are assessed for Iceland’s climate. The ALDIN biodome project won a special recognition from Icelandic president, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, last year as one of six projects nominated to receive the Icelandic President’s Innovation Award. However, recent thefts from the garden have undermined the project, potentially setting it back several years. Karen Róbertsdóttir, supervisor of the project, stated in an interview with RÚV that “the first year it was mostly kale and celery that were stolen. The year after that it was fruit trees and some garden tools. And this year it was pumpkins, rose bushes, and a specially-imported palm from Germany.” She stated that almost ISK 1 million has been invested in the research garden, and that much of their research has been undermined through the thefts. “If we’re growing plants here for several years and they’re stolen, then nothing comes of it. So what’s the point?” she stated. The garden is protected by an enclosure and surveillance cameras, neither of which seem to have deterred the thieves.

69,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Preschool Staffing Shortage Leaves 90 Positions Unfilled,2022/09/21,"In the latest numbers from RÚV, around 90 positions need to be filled before Reykjavík preschools can be considered fully staffed. Approximately 500 children aged 12 months and older remain on waitlists in Reykjavík City alone. Hjördís Rut Sigurjónsdóttir, Information Office for the Department of Education and Recreation at City of Reykjavík, has stated that filling the vacant positions has so far gone more smoothly than expected, with around 95% of full-time vacancies filled. Nevertheless, many children still remain on waitlists throughout the city, with 478 children 12 months and older and 48 children 18 months and older still waiting on placements. Not limited to the capital region, all of Iceland is experiencing something of a preschool crisis at the moment. Due to recent population growth, however, the problem is most keenly felt in Reykjavík and surrounding settlements. Traditionally, municipalities have accepted children into the preschool system starting at 18 to 24 months. Recently, there has been a push in the City of Reykjavík to start accepting children already beginning at 12 months into the system, to bridge the gap between parental leave and the preschool system. While the 12 month target was a much-requested concession for working parents, the preschool system has had to cope with much higher numbers this year, leaving many children stuck on waitlists. In a statement to RÚV, Hjördís said: “Recruitment for the kindergartens is going beyond expectations and it is clear that the actions taken by the City of Reykjavík have yielded results, such as advertisements and a new application website.” Despite the progress made, many parents feel that not enough is being done to address the problem, with some having to resort to private daycares or else reduce their rate of employment to care for their children. This August, working parents staged a demonstration at Reykjavík City Hall, turning the building into a sit-in daycare. The protest was an attempt to force action from a City Hall that they saw as doing little to care for their children. So far, Reykjavík City has pledged to expand capacity through construction of new preschools and expansion of existing facilities. However, critics say the expansion of facilities cannot address the fundamental staffing shortage and that deeper changes in the education and remuneration of preschool teachers must be made.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
70,Iceland Review,Mail No Longer Delivered at Home in Proposed Change to Postal System,2022/09/20,"A draft bill has been published on the government’s consultation portal that proposes changes to the postal system, including a reduction in at-home mailbox delivery. Among other changes, the draft as it currently stands would introduce increased use of mailbox centres over home mailboxes. Originally used in rural areas in order to reduce cost of service, the postal service uses such centres  in order to make fewer stops and to centralize services in lower-population settlements. However, mailbox centres could become increasingly common in Iceland’s urban areas as well, requiring residents to pick up their mail at a separate location. In the introduction to the draft it states: “it is clear if we look at the future of postal services both in this country and, for example, in Norway, there will be more use of mailbox complexes in the future instead of deliveries to every house, even in larger urban areas. This has resulted in savings and a positive environmental impact.” All residents have the ability to submit reviews and suggestions for the draft until the deadline of October 2.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
71,Iceland Review,Icelandic Delegation Present at Royal Funeral,2022/09/20,"President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and his wife Eliza Reid were present yesterday for the royal funeral in Westminster Abbey. The royal funeral gathered together hundreds of world leaders, with much of London shut down to traffic for the funeral procession. The late Elizabeth II was laid to rest at 11:00am, Icelandic time. In an interview with RÚV, the President stated that it was a vey solemn occasion, with psalms, organ, choir, and many other musical accompaniments. “The whole ceremony was significant in every way,” he stated, “and historic as well.” The President continued: “She performed military service, took part in protecting her homeland in the Second World War, and departs us now in the year 2022. In this ceremony, times long gone met with the contemporary. Then we look forward and wonder to ourselves how the future will be. What we know is that Queen Elizabeth did her dues and performed her duties conscientiously and with respect for her country and subjects.” The British Embassy in Reykjavík was closed for the occasion, and many Icelanders also followed along from home. Some facilities even offered live screenings of the state funeral, such as the Hrafnista elder care home in Hafnafjörður, which held a ceremony for the residents.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
72,Iceland Review,Ármúli Clinic Reaches Multibillion Agreement for Expansion,2022/09/19,"Ármúli Clinic, a private healthcare provider, has recently concluded a multibillion ISK deal with real estate developer Reitir to expand services, reports Stundin. Having secured a 20-year lease, the project aims to convert the clinic into a hospital over the next two years, with a large expansion in bed space and services provided. According to Sigurður Björnsson, the clinic’s current managing director, there has been significant growth in the last years and the clinic intends to expand operations further. Currently, the clinic specializes in joint replacement surgeries, preventative breast surgeries, orthopedic surgery, and treatment for obesity and other metabolic problems. The Ármúli clinic is also the only private clinic in Iceland with an inpatient unit. In an interview with Stundin, Sigurður stated “once we have gone through this, we will truly be a real hospital in every way. There will be everything here that can be found in a normal hospital. We are tripling the space we are in.” The clinic itself will not be investing in the construction. Instead, Reitir, owner of the Ármúli real estate, is expected to take on the necessary work of expanding the facilities. Some ISK 2.8 billion are expected to be invested in the clinic to make the necessary changes. The project is currently slated to be completed in the second half of 2024, with an annual lease for the newly improved property at ISK 270 million. Over the period of the lease, this will represent at least ISK 5.4 billion in revenue for the real estate developer.  ","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
73,Iceland Review,WWII Mortar Exploded in Controlled Detonation,2022/09/17,"The Coast Guard’s Explosives Unit was dispatched on Friday to detonate an unexploded British mortar that was found on Mt. Hlíðarfjall, just west of Akureyri, RÚV reports. The mortar dated back to World War II and was found not far from an area the British occupying forces used for training at the time. The mortar was found by local teacher Brynjar Karl Óttarsson. “I found [it] last fall and immediately suspected that it was a bomb,” he explained. “I waited  [to report it] because winter was setting in but then I let [the authorities] know about it in the summer and they came yesterday. We went back up there and blasted that bomb to smithereens.” Brynjar accompanied two Coast Guard specialists and an explosive expert from the British army to the site where the mortar was found and was allowed to observe the controlled detonation. “Hlíðarfjall is now one mystery poorer, but also a safer place to be,” he wrote in a Facebook post about the experience. “Dangerous explosive remnants have been found on the mountain in recent years,” wrote Brynjar Karl. “But this is the first unexploded bomb to pop up on Hlíðarfjall since I started making a habit of going there. The cylinder intact and the tail like new. Einu með öllu: ‘one with everything,’ as the saying goes.” “I got to watch the ceremony that goes along with destroying such a troublesome artifact,” he continued. “Place it against a large rock, attach an explosive device, position yourself at a reasonable distance, relay messages via radio to the appropriate parties about the impending explosion, and then press the button. KABOOM.” “I was shocked, to be honest. I figured on a sound, but not such a cacophony. Even the veteran jumped: ‘I never get used to this,’ said the Brit. The stillness and peace of the mountain of course magnified the din. The plume of smoke was not as magisterial. That bomb finally got to explode after 80 years. Mission accomplished and back down the mountain before dark.” Asked if he thought it was possible that there were more unexploded bombs hidden on Hlíðarfjall, Brynjar Karl said it was quite possible, given the area’s history as a military training site. But the location where the mortar was found is well off the beaten track, he assured reporters, and quite a distance from the nearest ski area. Even so, caution is always the best policy, he said. “There’s always associated risk if you’re out in nature.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
74,Iceland Review,"Hollywood-Burglar Nabs Four Packs of Cigarettes, Slips Away",2022/09/16,"The Prinsinn shop in Reykjavík suffered its fifth burglary in one year this week, Vísir reports. Taking a cue from Hollywood, the thief rappelled down through a hole in the roof before breaking a narrow hole in a glass door to escape. The burglar stole into the night with four packs of cigarettes. The owner of the Prinsinn sweet shop in the Árbær neighbourhood of Reykjavík, Guðjón Jónasson, is no stranger to break-ins. Having suffered several burglaries in the past, Guðjón told Vísir yesterday that no valuables are stored in his shop overnight. Enter a cat burglar. Rappelling down a hole that he had sawn in the roof, a masked thief landed on Guðjón’s shop floor earlier this week and headed for the cigarette cabinet. Thwarted by the near impregnability of the cabinet, the thief panicked. With four packs of cigarettes on his person, he headed for the exit, but was unable to escape – so he cut a hole in the glass. “But the hole, as you can see, is only yay big,” Guðjón told Vísir. “I can barely fit my shoulder through it. But somehow, the burglar manages to jump through the hole. He gets stuck, tips over, and leaks through the window. It’s like a scene from a movie.” This is the most elaborate break-in attempt that Prinsinn has suffered according to Guðjón: “This person probably watched Mission Impossible one too many times. I wonder whether there’s something bigger in the works.” If asked if he had a message for future burglars, Guðjón responded bluntly: “Don’t do it. There’s nothing of value to be obtained.” Security footage from the break-in can be viewed here.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
75,Iceland Review,Reykjavík International Film Festival Launches Despite Decrease in Funding,2022/09/16,"The Reykjavík International Film Festival (RIFF) will be beginning its 19th season this September 29th. However, the scope of the event will be slightly pulled back this year, given recent cuts in public funding to the arts. RIFF has become a centre of the film scene in Iceland is recent years, spotlighting lesser-known international directors. Despite the decline in funding, some 70 films will be featured from 59 nations. Especially prevalent this year will be short-form films, with some 207 short films featured. Additionally, a special emphasis is being placed this year on women in filmmaking, with a majority of the featured films directed by female directors. In a drive to reduce the environmental impact of RIFF, the use of printed materials such as programmes and posters will be reduced. Instead of programmes, RIFF is launching an app this year to help reduce paper waste. Movie-goers will be able to access the programme schedule, in addition to buy tickets and find other information about the screenings. Several films will be making their world premiere at this year’s RIFF, such as Icelandic director Sigurjón Sighvatsson’s Exxtinction Emergency, a documentary about the Extinction Rebellion environmental movement. RIFF has also been known for untraditional screenings, including drive-in car screenings and pool screening at Reykjavík’s swimming facilities. This year RIFF will also feature a glacial screening inside Langjökull, where Lars Ostenfeld’s documentary Into the Ice will be shown. According to a press release from RIFF, this represents “a unique opportunity to understand and perceive the power of filmmaking in the natural setting of the film’s subject.”  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
76,Iceland Review,Animal Welfare Officers Could Be Required on Icelandic Whaling Ships,2022/07/07,"Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir has stated that whaling vessels may be required to have an animal welfare officer aboard in the future. Emphasizing the moral value of animal life, she states that the goal of such regulation would be to ensure that the whales are treated as ethically as possible and that their suffering not be prolonged. Svandís said that since slaughterhouses face strict regulations under the government, that whaling ships should also be held accountable for the ethical treatment of their catch. Under the new system, a crew member from each whaling ship would be appointed as an animal rights observer and trained by veterinarians at MAST. These observers would then be responsible for documenting the whale hunt, from the moment the whale emerges to the moment the whale is loaded off the boat. Video documentation will then be submitted to MAST for review. These new regulations would allow the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries to exercise greater control over the practice of whaling, without requiring further legislation to be passed through Alþing. The comments come in response to the beginning of Iceland’s whaling season when the first whale in three years was caught on June 24. The quota for this year, set by Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute, includes 161 fin whales and 217 minke whales. Previously this year, Svandís stated that she saw little justification to extend the whaling permits which expire in 2023. If the permits are to be renewed, then whaling must be shown to be economically justifiable. As it stands, according to her, the economic benefits of whaling are marginal, and perhaps detrimental to Iceland’s international image.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0

78,Iceland Review,Krafla Geothermal Area Attracts International Research Project,2022/07/04,"Some 15 international doctoral students are studying the Krafla geothermal area in Northern Iceland to understand how to best use its energy resources, reports RÚV. Central to the investigation is a thorough measurement and mapping of the magma chamber below Krafla caldera. Magnús Tumi Guðmundsson, professor of geophysics at University of Iceland, has stressed the difficulty in determining the exact location of the magma chamber and its distribution across the area. However, given the extensive measurements now underway, Magnús Tumi says that the project will hopefully yield both theoretical and practical results. The doctoral students are part of the international research initiative, IMPROVE, a project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. The project focuses on early-career researchers and features co-operation between both academia and industry. IMPROVE focuses on two main sites: Mount Etna in Italy, one of the best-monitored volcanic areas in the world, and the Krafla caldera in Iceland, an important site for geothermal energy production. Within Iceland, the project is led by the Institute of Earth Sciences at University of Iceland, with support from the National Power Company of Iceland and 12 other universities.  The Krafla caldera was last active from 1975 to 1984. Prior to this, the only recorded eruption was in 1720, making it an unlikely candidate for Iceland’s next eruption, according to Magnús Tumi.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
79,Iceland Review,New Plant to Capture Ten Times More CO2 from Atmosphere at Hellisheiði,2022/06/29,"A new plant in Iceland will capture 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere, increasing the direct air carbon capture at Hellisheiði Power Station tenfold. Named Mammoth, the new facility adds to the existing 4,000 tonnes captured by the plant Orca, which commenced operations at the same location in September 2021, the first of its kind in the world. The plants are a project of Swiss company Climeworks, in collaboration with Carbfix and ON Power. Hellisheiði Power Station is the world’s third-largest geothermal power plant. Since 2012, the Carbfix project has been capturing carbon dioxide directly from the plant’s emissions, in collaboration with Climeworks. Once captured, the carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, pumped into the ground, and turned to stone, thus permanently removing it from the atmosphere. Orca and Mammoth, however, capture carbon directly from the atmosphere, making them key technologies in the fight against climate catastrophe. See Also: Set in Stone “Today is a very important day for Climeworks and for the industry as construction begins on our newest, large-scale direct air capture and storage plant,” stated Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Climeworks. The IPCC’s latest report shows that in addition to significant reductions in emissions, the capture and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere is a necessary component of most scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2100. The report states that to reach this goal, up to 310 gigatonnes of CO2 must be captured from the atmosphere by that time. “Large-scale carbon removal is vital in addition to rapid emission reduction if we are to reach our climate goals and our mineralisation technology provides the safest and most permanent storage mechanism for capture CO2,” stated Edda Sif Pind Aradóttir, CEO of Carbfix. Climeworks is currently running pilot projects around the world to determine other suitable locations for their carbon capture technology.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
80,Iceland Review,Flashing Red Light to Warn of Dangerous Waves at Reynisfjara,2022/06/29,"A flashing red light will be installed at Reynisfjara beach in South Iceland to warn visitors of dangerous waves. RÚV reports that the light will be installed within three weeks. Powerful sneaker waves at the beach have been the cause of several fatal accidents, despite signs that warn visitors to keep their distance from the water. The light will flash yellow or red based on the conditions at the beach. The colour code is based on a wave forecasting system that the Road and Coastal Administration began developing five years ago thanks to a grant from the Tourism Site Protection Fund. “With [the forecasting system] we can predict with some degree of certainty how the waves will be,” explained Fannar Gíslason, who manages the Road and Coastal Administration’s harbour division. “The risk has been colour-coded green, yellow, and red depending on how much danger is posed by the waves at Reynisfjara.” The light will be installed by the parking lot and walking path by Reynisfjara and will never be lit green. “There will be a flashing yellow warning light and it will be red when conditions are poor. We’ll have it like that at first, in any case. We’ll see how that goes, whether people notice it.” In order to determine which wave heights are dangerous to the beach’s visitors, wave data was cross-referenced with police diaries and incident records. According to Fannar, the current forecasting system is in sync with that data. A camera system will also be set up by the beach to allow authorities to observe the waves visually and calibrate those observations into the forecast.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
81,Iceland Review,Lupine Propagation Threatens Nature Preserve: ‘We want to keep our Icelandic flora’,2022/06/26,"Lupines may be beautiful, but they’re also an invasive species. RÚV reports that lupine propagation around the Krossanesborgir nature preserve near Akureyri, North Iceland, may well be having a significant—and negative—impact on indigenous plant and animal life. ‘The point of no return’ As Egill Bjarnason explained in his 2018 New York Times article about the ongoing lupine controversy in Iceland, “[t]he blue Nootka lupine are native to North America and a familiar sight in flower gardens there. They have spread wildly in Iceland since their introduction in the late 1970s to halt soil erosion.” But while the plant does have positive attributes (it’s a free ‘fertilizer factory,’ as Egill explains), and while tourists and even many Icelanders love the plant for its characteristic violet-blue blossoms, it spreads much more easily than originally anticipated and, among other places, has made significant inroads in Iceland’s central highlands, where originally, it was thought it wouldn’t be able to survive. Locals used to be encouraged to spread the seeds—some villages would even distribute free scoopfuls of seeds at gas stations. But in spring 2018, the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland stopped its seed distribution program after 42 years, with director Arni Bragason remarking of the plant and its impact on the local environment, “We’re at the point of no return.” Timing is everything
 Krossanesborgir was designated a nature preserve in 2004 in order to protect its diverse plant and bird life. But with the encroachment of lupine in the area, this this ecosystem is now endangered, says Jón Ingi Cæsarsson, the former chair of the Akureyri organizational committee. “All of the undergrowth and moor vegetation is going to vanish and instead, we’ll have these tall, beautiful plants. But that’s not something we want—we want to keep our Icelandic flora, especially in these nature preserves,” he said. Local officials are aware of the lupine situation and the plant is cut back on a regular basis, including in Krossanesborgir, says Rút Jónsdóttir, Akureyri divisional manager. “We usually begin [cutting back lupines] around June 15-20,” she explained. Working out the right time to start the mowing is difficult, she continued: too early, and birds will still be nesting in the area; too late, and the lupines will already bloomed. (Timing is everything when it comes to lupine eradication, explains Egill. “Killing the plant is a three- to five-year process that involves cutting them back at the peak of the bloom, when the plant is putting its energies into the flowers and the roots are correspondingly weakest. Mowing down the plants has proved more effective than herbicides.”) ‘It will take off if we don’t rein it in’ The lupine has not yet made significant inroads within Krossanesborgir, but Jón Ingi is nevertheless concerned that it may only be a matter of time. Roughly 30 species of birds nest in the area, he explained, making the area particularly important from a preservation standpoint. “The lupine is here and is lying in wait and will take off if we rein it in. We’ve seen what happened on Hrísey [a small island in Eyjafjörður, north of Akyreyri, known for its bird life]. The number of breeding birds will most definitely decrease [in Krossanesborgir], just like happened there.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
82,Iceland Review,Rabbit Rescue Hops to Rehome Sixty Bunnies,2022/06/25,"Sixty rabbits that were caught in the Elliðaárdalur valley on the east side of Reykjavík need furever homes, Vísir reports, but the process has been slow as there doesn’t seem to be much demand around the city for pet bunnies. Rabbit rescue organizer Gréta Sóley Sigurðardóttir says the project’s primary focus is catching and rehoming domesticated rabbits that are not suited for survival in the wild. Four of the 60 rabbits currently being kept in a temporary shelter are former pet rabbits that were released in the valley by owners who no longer wanted them. “As it stands, we’re not taking in [as many rabbits] as we were in the beginning,” explained Gréta Sóley. “We’re mainly focused on pet rabbits that are tossed out because they don’t survive long after they’ve been released and then we also watch out for those that are wounded or injured because it’s urgent in those cases to bring them in.” Since the fall, Villikanínur, a rescue that focuses solely on catching and rehoming these so-called “wild” rabbits, has been working with the Dýrahjálp Íslands animal shelter and the city’s Dýrahald animal services organization to catch many of the 150 – 200 rabbits currently living in Elliðaárdalur. Though rabbit owners might think they are setting their former pets free in a hospitable environment, Villikanínur notes that unfortunately, most of these domesticated rabbits “aren’t as free and living their best life as many people think,” as “they are not made for Icelandic winter.” Most of the rescued rabbits are being housed in a shelter that was made available to the project organizers on a temporary basis. But until some of them are found homes or short-term fosters, few of their bunny buddies still living in the wild can be taken in. If you’re interested in adopting or fostering a rescued rabbit, check the Dýrahjálp website or follow Villikanínur on Instagram. You can also donate to the rescue, which is entirely volunteer-run, uses all donations for veterinary expenses, and hopes to one day open a “bunny rescue center where people can bring their bunny instead of letting them go ‘free’” as well as a permanent shelter in Elliðaárdalur where the rabbits can “come inside and stay warm and have enough hay, pallets, and water.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
83,Iceland Review,Road to Landmannalaugar Opens For the Summer,2022/06/24,"The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration opened the road to Landmannalaugar via Sigalda yesterday, making the popular Laugavegur hiking route accessible for the summer, Vísir reports. The other point of access to Landmannalaugar will soon open as well. IRCA representative Magnús Ingi Jónsson stated that it will most likely be open to 4×4 vehicles by the weekend. A map published by the IRCA shows which areas of the Icelandic highland interior is already open to traffic and which roads are still closed. It should be noted that even if the roads have been opened for the summer, prospective drivers should still take precautions when driving Iceland’s F-roads and consult IRCA’s road condition maps before driving. The Kjölur route was the first of the highland roads to open this summer, on June 10, with Kaldadalsvegur soon after. The Sprengisandur route still has copious amounts of snow and likely won’t open until July according to Magnús Ingi.

84,Iceland Review,Whaling Restarts in Iceland Following Four-Year Hiatus,2022/06/23,"Two whaling ships owned by the company Hvalur hf. set off from Reykjavík harbour yesterday to begin the whaling season, RÚV reports. No commercial whaling has taken place in Iceland for four years, though a single minke whale was hunted in 2021. The whaling licence held by Hvalur hf. expires next year, and Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries has indicated that the practice of whaling may be discontinued in Iceland afterwards. The whale hunting quota issued by Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute for this season is 161 fin whales and 217 minke whales. The quota is based on appraisals from the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission and the International Whaling Commission. According to RÚV, the number of fin whales in Icelandic waters has increased steadily since counting began in 1987. Its conservation status is nevertheless listed as “vulnerable” according to the CITES Appendix. As of 2018, the IUCN Red List places minke whales in the “least concern” category. The whale hunting season lasts from June until late September, and some 150 employees are expected to staff Hvalur hf.’s whaling ships, whaling station in Hvalfjörður, West Iceland, and their processing plant in Hafnarfjörður, in the capital area. Hvalur hf.’s CEO Kristján Loftsson has stated that the main reason for the company’s lack of activity since 2018 is conflict with Iceland’s Food and Veterinary Authority concerning the company’s whaling station. He has also previously cited poor market conditions for whale products and the COVID-19 pandemic as factors. Whaling company Hvalur hf. has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years. Public outcries followed when the company killed a pregnant fin whale and a rare hybrid whale in 2018. Hvalur hf. was at risk of losing their whaling licence after failing to submit captains’ logs for the 2014, 2015, and 2018 seasons. The company has been sued by three of its shareholders as well as by activists. Earlier this year, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated she sees little reason to permit whaling after Hvalur hf.’s current licence expires in 2023. In an op-ed published in Morgunblaðið newspaper, Svandís wrote that there is little evidence that whaling is economically beneficial to Iceland. She also pointed out that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. Svandís stated that the government would carry out an assessment on the potential economic and social impact of whaling this year.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
85,Iceland Review,New Technology for Prawn Fishing Uses Light to Reduce Emissions,2022/06/22,"An Icelandic company has developed a technology for prawn fishing that uses light to herd prawn up from the sea floor. This allows the fishing equipment to remain off the sea floor, leading to less disturbance of the environment and lower emissions than conventional trawling. The technology is set to be put on the market soon. “We are developing the next generation of fishing equipment. Fishing equipment that can fly close to the bottom without touching the bottom. Then we have a light that herds,” Halla Jónsdóttir, founder of Optitog, told RÚV reporters. Optitog has named this patented light beam technology “Virtual Trawl” and has data that shows that it results in higher yields, compared to using the equipment with the light off. “We have a special light that forms a sort of wall or line in the sea and we see that it works to herd [the prawn].” The prawn swims ahead of the light, up off the sea floor and into the nets. It’s possible to set the equipment so that it travels a consistent distance above the sea floor, for example 30 centimetres [11.8 inches]. Because Optitog’s equipment does not trawl along the sea floor, it encounters 30% less resistance than conventional trawling, meaning the method drastically reduces fuel consumption. By leaving the sea floor largely undisturbed, the new technology also reduces CO2 emissions caused by disturbing organic material on the bottom of the ocean. Halla says that a Norwegian party is working to put Optitog on the market as an environmentally-friendly fishing technology. Halla believes the technology could be applied to fishing other species.","Business,Nature,Sci&Tech",1,0,1,0,0,0
86,Iceland Review,Government and New Landowner Agree to Protect Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon,2022/06/21,"Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon, a popular tourist site in South Iceland, is being sold from one private owner to another. The Icelandic government had the right to step in and purchase the land for the state, but forewent that right. However, Environment Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and the purchaser of the property have signed an agreement to work toward protecting the site. The picturesque canyon and the surrounding area, covering 315 hectares, was put up for sale six years ago. A buyer made an offer on the property earlier this year and was accepted. However, as Fjaðrárgljúfur is on Iceland’s Nature Conservation Register, the state had pre-emptive purchase rights to the land. This means that if it chose to do so, it could step in and take over the purchase from the prospective landowner. The government ultimately decided not to exercise that right, but the Environment Minister has now signed an agreement with the to-be landowner that is expected to ensure the canyon’s protection. According to a government notice announcing the agreement, the Environment Ministry did not consider it necessary to intervene in the purchase in order to guarantee the area would be protected. The agreement ensures the protection of the area, and necessary infrastructure development, will be a joint project between the state and the new owner. Until now, no admission or parking fees have been charged at the site. The government notice states that in accordance with the Nature Conservation Act, “collection of fees shall not impair or impede the free movement of persons through the protected area who do not use the car park,” and that “the collection and disposition of fees that may be charged for the parking of motor vehicles shall be in its entirety used to develop services, operations, and infrastructure for those travelling in the area.” The notice also states that neighbouring landowners whose land contains part of the canyon have expressed their willingness to collaborate on the protection of Fjaðrárgljúfur.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
87,Iceland Review,"Less Cod, More Haddock To Be Fished Next Year",2022/06/16,"The Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Research Institute has suggested a 6% decrease in cod catch quotas for the next fishing season. A notice from the Institute states that the decline is due to a lower estimate of the reference biomass compared to previous years and the effect of the catch stabiliser in the harvest control rule. The Institute is hopeful for cod in Icelandic waters, stating: “The reference biomass of cod is expected to increase slightly in the next two to three years when the 2019 and 2020 cohorts enter the reference biomass as they are estimated to be above average in terms of size.” Meanwhile, suggested catch quotas for haddock increase to 62,219 tonnes, up 23% from last year. MFRI Director Þorsteinn Sigurðsson stated in an introductory meeting that several fish stocks, including tusk, ling, blue ling, beaked redfish, anglerfish, witch, megrim, and langoustine, have been experiencing poor recruitment in the past few years, Fiskifréttir report. These fish stay in the warmer waters to the south and west coast of Iceland. “Unfortunately, there seems to be little change for the better. The reasons for this negative development are unknown, but the most likely explanation is that it’s due to changes in Iceland’s marine environment.”

88,Iceland Review,Master Plan Passed Through Parliament Despite Opposition,2022/06/16,"The third phase of the Master Plan for Nature Protection and Energy Utilisation was passed through Parliament yesterday, with 34 votes for and seven against. Fifteen abstained from voting. The Master Plan was last passed through Parliament just under ten years ago and has often proven divisive as it mandates which rivers will be developed for hydropower plants and which ones will be allowed to remain untouched. Before the Master Plan passed through Parliament, the Environment and Communications Committee made some compromises that have been hotly contested by nature conservationists and the minority parties in Parliament. An outline of which rivers will be developed for Hydro power plants The Master Plan contains a list of locations where hydropower plants could theoretically rise and divides them into three categories: the Energy Utilisation category for places suitable for power plant construction, the On-hold category for places that require more research and preparation to figure out if they’re suitable or not, and the Protected category, for places that are deemed necessary for nature conservation. Controversial options put on hold The Environment and Communications Committee’s majority published the results of their work recently and in what looks like an effort to compromise and hold off on making decisions about controversial locations, Kjalölduveita and Héraðsvötn will be moved from the Protection category to On Hold while Skrokkalda and powerplants in the lower part of Þjórsá river will be moved from the Energy Utilisation category to the on-hold category. Minority and conservationists object, division within majority parties Representatives of the Icelandic Environment Association have stated that there is no new data to support moving these two places to the on-hold category and that the change is entirely political. Three minority parties in Parliament had suggested an amendment to the bill that would keep Héraðsvötn and Kjalölduveita in the protected category instead of moving them to the On-hold category. The suggestion was rejected with 33 votes against 21. One MP abstained and Bjarni Jónsson, MP for the Left-green movement voted for it, the only MP in the Majority to do so. Bjarni is one of the Left-green Movements representatives in the Environment and Communications Committee and refused to sign the committee’s report, due to his opposition to moving Héraðsvötn to the On-hold category. Orri Páll Jóhannsson, the other of two Left-Green representatives in the committee told RÚV: “If we need to enlarge the on-hold category to pass it through parliament I will stick by the decision with the arguments mentioned in the committee report, reiterating that power options in the on-hold category will be reassessed.” On the subject of Héraðsvötn and Kjalölduveita, Orri recognised that the rivers have significant nature conservation interest but that they are controversial and need to be investigated further. He maintained that moving these places to the on-hold category did not mean that they would be moved to the energy utilisation category straight away, absolutely not.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
89,Iceland Review,"Reynisfjara Safety Measures Stalled Due to Bureaucracy, Landowners Claim",2022/06/14,"Landowners and local authorities have differing viewpoints on what has hindered increased safety measures at Reynisfjara beach, following repeated fatal accidents over the past few years. The spokesperson for a group of landowners by Reynisfjara states that the authorities have hindered improvements, not them, Vísir reports, while the Icelandic Tourist Board’s Director General states that landowners’ opposition has stopped further Reynisfjara safety measures. The popular tourist destination is not owned by the state but by various landowners, but a committee is now considering closing the beach to travellers. The debate over Reynisfjara safety measures has resurged after a tourist in their seventies died there last Friday, swept away by the powerful sneaker waves characteristic of the tourist attraction beach. According to Morgunblaðið’s report, a committee established by the Minister of Tourism found that the government had the authority to close places considered dangerous, even against the will of the local landowners. Morgunblaðið also reported the Director-General of the Icelandic Tourist Board statement that while security measures such as warning flags and blinking lights had been suggested, some of the landowners had objected, and their instalment had stalled. The Tourism Minister’s committee is still working on their suggestions for closure, and the result can be expected before the summer break. Íris Guðnadóttir is a spokesperson for one of the group of landowners that own part of Reynisfjara. She told Vísir: “hearing this in the media, that landowners, that we are against security measures, hurts. These are difficult times. We are very willing to cooperate and talk.” She added that the locals, such as her family, are the ones who face the aftermath of the fatal accidents, so they are well aware of the severity of the matter. According to Íris, the South Iceland police and landowners had agreed to put up new signs with lights on the beach in 2017. The sign was ready, but the matter stalled because the Ministry of Tourism established a committee. “A risk assessment was to be made, and actions were to be coordinated nationwide. Now, it’s been over three years.” Since then, there has been no direct action to discourage travellers from getting too close to the water except for a sign put up by the landowners. The government has funded a wave forecast system that is accessible on The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA)’ website but Íris criticises its lack of use elsewhere, calling for action instead of new committees. When asked about ideas to close Reynisfjara to travellers, at least when the conditions are at their most dangerous, Íris remains unconvinced. Conditions on the beach vary greatly and can change very quickly. “When the conditions are like that, we need to keep people away from the basalt columns. When the sea goes up to the rocks, people shouldn’t be climbing or running across the rocks to get to the cave. We need to keep people safe. But Reynisfjara isn’t dangerous if you sit up on the beach at a safe distance from the water,” stated Íris.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
90,Iceland Review,Reykjanes Earthquakes: Uncertainty Phase Lifted,2022/06/13,"The National Police Commissioner has, after conferring with the Reykjanes Police commissioner, lifted the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management’s Uncertainty Phase due to the ongoing Reykjanes earthquakes in southwest Iceland.  The uncertainty phase was declared on May 15 this year, when the Reykjanes earthquakes had been ongoing for a few weeks. Land rise of up to 5.5cm was detected from April 28 to May 28 by mt. Þorbjörn, along with the increased seismic activity of up to 800 quakes per day. The land rise is thought to be due to the formation of a magma intrusion similar to the ones occurring in 2020, one of which led to the 2020 Reykjanes eruption. In recent days, seismic activity has decreased again. The recurring seismic activity support theories that the Reykjanes peninsula might be entering a new eruptive phase. The last such period was 800-1240, with 18 known eruptions over 440 years.  The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management will continue preparing risk assessments, counter-action plans and response programs with national and local authorities, companies, and institutions to prepare for what comes next.  If seismic activity increases again in concurrence with land rise in the area, authorities will declare an uncertainty phase again.

91,Iceland Review,Iceland Tightens Regulations on Blood Mare Farms,2022/06/02,"Blood mare farming, the practice of extracting blood from pregnant mares for sale, will soon be subject to a licence in Iceland. This is one of several measures the Icelandic government is taking to tighten and clarify regulations on the controversial practice. The new regulations will be valid for three years, during which authorities will “assess its future,” according to a government notice. Iceland’s blood mare farm industry made international headlines last winter after the Germany-based Animal Welfare Foundation posted a documentary on YouTube under the heading “Iceland – Land of the 5,000 Blood Mares.” The documentary contained footage showcasing ill treatment of horses on blood farms, including horses being shouted at and hit. Read More: Blood Farms Documentary Shocks the Nation Following the publication of the video, the Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir appointed a working group to review the practice and whether it ensured the welfare of the animals involved. The working group’s report, published yesterday, concluded that existing regulations on the practice were “very vague and not acceptable, as they concern a fairly extensive and controversial activity.” In addition to implementing a licencing system for the practice, the group proposed tightening regulations on blood mare farming “with regard to the views of stakeholders and others with whom the working group spoke.” These include more detailed provisions on conditions and facilities at the farms, monitoring of horse health, grooming, and temperament assessment, as well as the working methods of blood collection and internal and external monitoring. The report’s authors proposed banning production systems based on mass production of mares’ blood, as they could endanger the welfare of the animals. The working group consisted of representatives from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, the Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST), and the University of Iceland’s Centre for Ethics. The Animal Welfare Foundation and many other interest groups were consulted in the writing of the report. Since the 1980s, horse farmers in Iceland have been able to gain extra income by extracting the hormone Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) from their pregnant mares. This hormone exists in pregnant mares’ blood and can be removed and sold for hefty sums. To begin with, blood farming was a secondary practice on horse farms, but later, some farmers turned their focus to the practice, with data from 2019 indicating that 95 farmers supplied pregnant mare’s blood. Just one company, Ísteka, buys and processes blood harvested from mares in Iceland. The hormone extracted from pregnant mares is mainly used to boost fertility in other farm animals. Only a handful of countries operate blood farms besides Iceland: Russia, Mongolia, China, Uruguay, and Argentina.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
92,Iceland Review,Scrapie-Resistant Sheep Multiply in East Iceland,2022/06/02,"The lambing season is going well at Þernunes farm in Reyðarfjörður, East Iceland, where 27 lambs have been born that carry the ARR genotype that protects them against the fatal disease scrapie, RÚV reports. The genotype was first found in Iceland on this very farm last January, through a research project that analysed thousands of genetic samples from sheep across the country. Researchers believe that careful breeding of sheep that carry the ARR genotype could eradicate scrapie from Iceland. Read More: Good Breeding Scrapie is a degenerative and fatal disease that affects sheep. Because it is highly contagious and can persist in flocks for decades, a flock in which the disease is discovered must be culled. Within the European Union, sheep that carry the ARR genotype do not need to be culled, even when scrapie is diagnosed within their flock, as research shows the gene protects them from both contracting and transmitting the disease. Þernunes is home to the only ram so far found in Iceland to carry the gene: Gimsteinn (Gemstone). He carries the genotype on one chromosome, meaning that his descendants have a 50% chance of inheriting it. Þernunes farmer Steinn Björnsson says that by the end of lambing season, he expects around 40 of the farm’s lambs will carry the gene. Another genotype known to protect sheep from scrapie, T137, was also recently found in at least four Icelandic sheep. Extensive research in Italy has found that T137 protects sheep from scrapie, but it is not officially recognised by the EU as the ARR genotype.","Nature,Sci&Tech,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
93,Iceland Review,"Scientists Document Glacier Melt in Real Time: ‘We Have to Make a Conscious, Informed Decision About Which Future We Choose’",2022/05/28,"New footage and photography compiled by a team of scientists at the University of Iceland shows three decades of glacial melt in just over three minutes. CNN reports that the team superimposes archival aerial photos on top of contemporary drone footage to show the dramatic effect that warming climates have had on glaciers in Southeast Iceland. Some of these glaciers are retreating at a rate of 150 metres [492 ft] a year. Since 2000, it’s estimated that Iceland’s glaciers have decreased by some 800 km2 [309 mi2]. The team is led by Þorvarður (Thorri) Árnason, director at the Hornafjörður Research Centre. “About 14 years ago, I started to do repeat photography at one of the glaciers here, Hoffellsjökull,” Þorvarður told CNN. “I went once a month for eight years. It’s like visiting an old friend, there’s a sense of familiarity.” Iceland has twenty outlet glaciers that extend from the Vatnajökull ice cap. All of them, Þorvarður says, have receded in the time he has been observing them. Some experts say that if global warming conditions continue apace, Iceland’s glaciers are at risk of disappearing completely. See Also: Snæfellsjökull Could Be Gone in Thirty Years “We need to tell people what the reality is,” says Þorvarður. “On the other hand, we don’t want to frighten people, to immobilize them through anxiety.” Having documented the present situation, Þorvarður and his team are now turning their attention toward the future. “We want to pre-visualize what our fastest retreating glacier, Breiðamerkurjökull, will look like 100 years from now. Based on worse-case, business as usual, and best case. There is always a range of potential futures that is open to us. There is still a chance for the wounds to heal and for the glaciers to recover, at least to some extent. We have to make a conscious, informed decision about which future we choose.” See the full documentary short, in English, on CNN, here.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
94,Iceland Review,"Six Million Plants This Year, But Production Still Short of Carbon Neutrality Goal",2022/05/25,"Iceland needs to rapidly increase its plant cultivation in order to meet the government’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2040, RÚV reports. Þröstur Eysteinsson, director of the Icelandic Forest Service, says that in order to meet the goal, plant production in Iceland will have to at least double over the next three to five years, and that production capacity will need to increase even more after that. Currently, there is not enough room in local nurseries and greenhouses to meet this demand. “As the situation stands, our greenhouses are at full capacity,” Þröstur explained in an interview. “Because it’s May, the spring sowing has already been planned out and it isn’t possible to add anything that will be ready in spring 2023, that is to say, next spring. So for any new projects that are coming in, the earliest they could get plants is 2024.” The Forest Service intends to deliver six million plants this year, says Þröstur, which is equivalent to pre-crash levels of production. “It was around five million last year, and four million the year before that. This is a rapid increase. Then we need seven to eight million next year, which we may not manage, and ten to twelve in 2025.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
95,Iceland Review,Land Rises Four Centimetres on Reykjanes,2022/05/20,"The land around Svartsengi, on the Reykjanes peninsula, has risen 4 centimetres since April 21. The uplift is most likely due to a magma intrusion 4-5km below the surface. Satellite images published by the Icelandic Met Office indicate the intrusion is 7-8km long and stretches west of Þorbjörn mountain and underneath Svartsengi Power Station. An earthquake swarm is ongoing at the site, but there is no sign of volcanic unrest. These geological events are reminiscent of landrise that occurred in the area in 2020. While in that instance, the magma that was collecting underground never reached the surface, a volcanic eruption did occur nearby on the peninsula in 2021, at Fagradalsfjall. While the 2021 eruption was far from infrastructure, the growing magma intrusion is located underneath a geothermal power plant, which is at risk of damage if magma reaches the surface. Residents of the nearby town of Grindavík were invited to a town hall meeting yesterday evening to discuss the geological activity and go over preparedness in the case of an eruption. Travellers and hikers on the Reykjanes peninsula are warned to stay away from steep inclines, where earthquakes can cause landslides or rockfall. The Civil Protection Department website features earthquake preparedness information in English. Experts have stated that it is too early to say whether the activity will result in an eruption.

96,Iceland Review,Reykjanes Earthquakes: Uncertainty Phase Declared,2022/05/16,"The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management has declared a phase of uncertainty due to the ongoing earthquake swarm on the Reykjanes peninsula in Southwest Iceland. Six earthquakes over M3 were detected on the peninsula yesterday, with the strongest measuring M4.7. Specialists say earthquakes and uplift in the area are likely signs of magma collecting below the surface. There are no signs an eruption is imminent. “We have seen, since before the weekend, indications that expansion and uplift are occurring by Svartsengi similar to what happened in 2020,” Met Office Earthquake Hazards Coordinator Kristín Jónsdóttir told RÚV. “That is we think it is quite likely that we are seeing the beginning of magma collecting below the surface at Svartsengi and it’s of course not unthinkable that could end in an eruption, but it is still much too early to say.” The 2020 activity Kristín is referring to was a period of uplift (land rise) by Þorbjörn mountain on the Reykjanes peninsula. The uplift ended without an eruption ever occurring. An eruption did occur on the peninsula last year, however, as many readers know, and it was preceded by weeks of powerful earthquakes felt across Southwest Iceland. Volcanologist Þorvaldur Þórðarson has stated there is a 50% chance of another eruption on Reykjanes this year. Travellers and hikers on the Reykjanes peninsula are warned to stay away from steep inclines, where earthquakes can cause landslides or rockfall.

97,Iceland Review,Arctic Fox Gets Starring Role in New Netflix Series,2022/05/14,"Iceland’s Arctic fox has a starring role in the upcoming Netflix series “Wild Babies,” RÚV reports. Narrated by Helena Bonham Carter, the eight-part series explores the trials and tribulations of baby animals such as elephants, cuckoos, pangolins, seal pups, mongeese, and macaques in the beginning of their lives. Arctic fox cub Silver is followed in episode 7, “Hostile Homes,” which also features baby penguins and adolescent lions. The episode, which was shot in Hornstrandir Nature Reserve in the Westfjords, includes the first-ever footage of Arctic foxes swimming. This is rather remarkable, as the animals famously hate getting wet. However, by overcoming their aversion to immersion, Arctic fox parents are able to catch more prey and thereby increase the chances of their cubs surviving. The episode also shows the cubs learning to swim themselves and hunting for the first time. The footage for the episode was taken over July and August last year, when the film crew accompanied scientists from the Icelandic Institute of Natural History on their field visits to Hornstrandir. Mammalian biologist Ester Rut Unnsteinsdóttir chose appropriate locations for filming, ensuring that the foxes were respected and undisturbed by the presence of the crew for the duration of the shoot. “Wild Babies” is on Netflix now.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
98,Iceland Review,Tourist Nearly Drowns at Reynisfjara Beach,2022/05/12,"An ambulance was called out to Reynisfjara beach in South Iceland this week when a Spanish tourist nearly drowned, mbl.is reports.

He eventually managed to get himself back onto the shore, chilled and agitated but otherwise fine. Photographer Sandra Pawłowska, who witnessed the incident, says the man nearly drowned. He had gotten undressed and waded into the water intentionally while his friend took photographs of him. Sandra says families at the site led their children away so they would not see what was happening. Reynisfjara is a black sand beach with basalt column formations that is a popular tourist site. The powerful “sneaker” waves at the site have previously claimed several lives, most recently last November, when a Chinese tourist died after being swept out to sea.

The canyon is up for sale and an offer from a private investor has been accepted, but the state has pre-emptive purchase rights to the land. The purchase price is estimated between ISK 300 and 350 million [$2.3-2.7 million; €2.2-2.5 million]. The canyon and surrounding area covering 315 hectares was put up for sale six years ago. A buyer has now been found, and the sale manager revealed that they were Icelandic and work in tourism. The state can step in and buy the land if Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson decide to do so, but they have a limited window of time. Fjaðrárgljúfur has been managed by the Environment Agency of Iceland in recent years. The agency has closed the area for weeks-long periods in recent years when tourist traffic was causing damage to the fragile vegetation around the canyon. The spot was not well-known to foreign tourists until it appeared in a music video by Justin Bieber in 2015, which put it on the map. Until now, there has been no admission fee for visitors to the canyon. It is not known whether the private purchaser aims to profit from the land by charging admission.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0

102,Iceland Review,Bigger and Deeper Pool for Seals at Reykjavík Zoo,2022/05/06,"A new seal enclosure will greatly expand the space seals have for swimming at Reykjavík Family Park and Zoo. Reykjavík City Council approved a motion today to being the construction of a new pool and service building at the zoo. There are four seals currently in the enclosure, which is also used to rehabilitate wild animals in distress. The new pool will connect to the older one, where the seals are currently kept. It will be significantly deeper, allowing the seals to dive to a depth of four metres [13 feet]. It will include large windows along one side that will allow park visitors to see the seals from a new perspective. “This addition will greatly improve the zoo’s ability to provide educational services in addition to taking better care of the animals, including reception of wild animals in distress in connection with Reykjavík Animal Services,” a notice from the City of Reykjavík states. The pool is expected to be completed by November 2022 and will cost an estimated ISK 125 million [$955 million; €904,000]. Most of the animals at Reykjavík Family Park and Zoo are domestic animals such as sheep and goats. Keeping seals at the park has been controversial. In 2019, Marine biologist and Reykjavík Family Park and Zoo division head Þorkell Heiðarsson argued that pups born in the enclosure should be released into the wild.

103,Iceland Review,"Iceland Lagging Behind on Climate, Minister Suggests",2022/05/03,"At a Climate Day conference in Reykjavík, Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson stated that Iceland would need to do “even better” with regard to greenhouse-gas emissions, as Iceland is lagging behind countries to which it would like to compare favourably. Many of Iceland’s foremost experts on climate change convened at the Harpa Music and Conference Hall in Reykjavík for Climate Day (sponsored by Iceland’s Environment Agency). Over 20 lectures were scheduled from representatives of various institutions and agencies in the hopes of discussing global warming in layman’s terms. Among today’s speakers was Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate, who revealed plans to make Iceland’s emissions ledger accessible to the public in one place, making monitoring the country’s climate goals easier. As noted by RÚV, Guðlaugur Þór referred to data from Iceland’s Environment Agency, which showed that emissions for which Iceland is directly responsible totalled 2,716 tonnes in 2020 – down by 13% since 2005, the benchmark year for Iceland’s commitments. Emissions in 2020 were 5% lower than in 2019. “Improvements must be made,” Guðlaugur Þór stated. “When you delve into the numbers, you can see that the biggest decline in emissions has been in road transportation, and it is believed that the pandemic played a big role in that regard. Iceland lags behind many countries to which we’d like to compare ourselves when it comes to climate change. This means that we need to work fast and work together to achieve better results.” Guðlaugur also emphasised the importance of basing climate action on scientific facts and revealed that work had begun to analyse the Ministry’s projects to achieve goals put forth in the government agreement. According to the Minister, information on emissions is to be accessible to the public via a new climate dashboard. “It’s my hope that data on the dashboard will be interconnected so that one can access a wide variety of information in an easy way. We need to publish updates regularly on how well we’re doing in meeting our goals,” Guðlaugur remarked.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
104,Iceland Review,Iceland’s Wilderness Mapped in More Detail than Ever,2022/04/27,"Scientists have mapped Iceland’s uninhabited wilderness in more detail than ever before. A new report on the project, prepared by the Wildland Research Institute (WRi) on behalf of Icelandic initiative Óbyggð kortlagning provides information that can help policymakers and nature conservationists preserve these areas in their best possible form. Previous studies for the European Union Wilderness Register have shown that Iceland retains approximately 43% of Europe’s top one percent wildest areas. Around half of Iceland’s Central Highland falls under the definition of uninhabited wilderness, and the report divides it into 17 distinct areas. One third of the uninhabited wilderness mapped in the project is privately owned, while the other two thirds are on public land. The areas were mapped and defined according to international standards. WRi Director Dr. Steve Carver told RÚV it is important for Icelanders to be able to clearly distinguish between wilderness and other areas, and that as wild areas diminish globally, Iceland’s wilderness will become still more valuable. “If we look at biodiversity goals after 2020, the top priority is protecting the remaining unspoilt areas,” Dr. Carver stated. “That’s why they need to be mapped. Once a line has been drawn on a map, it can be put into context legally, in Icelandic law on nature conservation, so it’s possible to make decisions about where to build, where power lines can be laid, and where hydropower plans can be built so as not to spoil this important resource.” Iceland’s Nature Conservation Act No 60/2013 outlines the goal of mapping wilderness across the whole of Iceland by June 2023. The report identifies four main historical threats to wilderness in Iceland: impacts from geothermal and hydropower infrastructure; tourism; recreational 4×4 driving; and off-road driving. “These have resulted in the steady attrition of wilderness areas over the last 80 years. Many of these threats are ongoing with further expansion of electrical power generation and associated transmission infrastructure,” the report states. Proposals to expand hydropower, geothermal power, and wind power generation in the Central Highlands are “of particular concern,” according to the report’s authors, as they are “all capable of vastly impacting wilderness qualities.” Interested readers can view the full report online.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
105,Iceland Review,Bird Flu Widespread in Wild Birds in Iceland,2022/04/25,"Bird flu was confirmed in eight out of 15 samples that were taken from wild birds in Iceland last week, Iceland’s Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) announced. MAST has encouraged farmers of domestic fowl and other bird owners to take measures to prevent infection among their birds. The risk of infection to humans and other animals is, however, considered very low. The eight positive samples processed last week were from three different regions of the country. Three were from gannets found in Njarðvík and Grindavík, Southwest Iceland; three from gannets found on Snæfellsnes peninsula, West Iceland; one from a greylag goose in Akureyri, North Iceland; and one from a great black-backed gull in Húsavík (also in North Iceland). The first positive samples among wild birds were confirmed earlier this month. “It is clear that at this time bird flu is widespread among wild birds and the risk of infection for domestic fowl is therefore great,” the notice from MAST reads. “Birds kept partially outdoors, or in buildings where infection prevention is inadequate, are most at risk of infection.” To prevent infection, MAST encourages farmers to keep fowl indoors or under solid roofing, so that neither wild birds nor their droppings can come into contact with the domestic fowl. Farmworkers are recommended to switch shoes and put on protective clothing when attending to the birds and not use the same gear outside of where the birds are kept. Despite the cases found among wild birds in Iceland, Brigitte Brugger, a MAST veterinarian who specialises in domestic fowl, told Vísir humans have no reason to worry about getting infected with bird flu – nor worry about their pets contracting it. “There are no indications that humans contract these viruses. There are very few known exceptions where people who have had a lot of contact with groups of infected birds have contracted [bird flu] and gotten mild symptoms, but the average person has nothing to fear at this time,” Brigitte stated. Cat and dog owners need not worry either, according to Brigitte, though if pets bring home wild birds, owners should avoid touching them with bare hands, and should instead dispose of the birds using plastic bags or gloves.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
106,Iceland Review,"50% Chance of Another Reykjanes Eruption this Year, Expert Says",2022/04/19,"Volcanologist Þorvaldur Þórðarson reckons there is a 50/50 chance that an eruption will begin on the Reykjanes peninsula by the end of the year. It could occur on land, like last year’s Geldingadalir eruption, active between March and September of 2021, or out in the ocean near the Reykjanes coast. While last year’s eruption was minimally disruptive to the surrounding area, there is always the possibility that another could cause air pollution, ashfall, or disruptions to international flights through Keflavík Airport, Þorvaldur told RÚV. Earthquake swarms occurred on the Reykjanes peninsula last week and over the weekend. The second swarm began on Sunday morning and included two earthquakes over M3 in magnitude. The activity has since calmed down, but Þorvaldur says it’s possible the earthquakes are a sign of magma moving under the surface. There are, however, no signs that an eruption is imminent. Eruptions at sea carry different risks to eruptions on land, according to Þorvaldur. “If it’s a sort of small, neat tourist eruption like the one in Fagradalsfjall then it’s good to have it on land, but if it’s bigger and more powerful, then the situation is different, and there there is maybe more at risk both in terms of lava flow and also in terms of sulphur pollution,” he stated. “There is much more sulphur pollution from eruptions on land simply because eruptions at sea or underwater create a lot of steam, and this steam condenses in the plume and takes out the sulphur. If the eruption is on land then we don’t have so much steam and much less of the sulphur is removed immediately, so it falls to the ground or spreads further and causes pollution. That’s the downside of an eruption on land.” However, an eruption at sea that breaches the water’s surface could cause significant ashfall on land across the Southwest region, including as far north as Hvalfjörður, Þorvaldur says. He adds that if an eruption does occur, it’s even possible magma would breach the surface in several locations at once. Experts have stated that the Geldingadalir eruption likely marks the start of a period of increased volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula.

107,Iceland Review,Bird Flu Confirmed in Iceland,2022/04/17,"Bird flu has been confirmed in three wild birds in Iceland in recent days: a pink-footed goose in Hornafjörður in Southeast Iceland, a raven in Skeiða in South Iceland, and a gannet in Selvogur, also in South Iceland. The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) issued a statement about the presence of bird flu on Friday. But while poultry farmers are advised to take precautions to keep their chickens from becoming infected, the general public is not considered to be at risk for contracting the infection from consuming eggs or poultry. MAST has activated its plan for responding to and preventing infectious diseases in birds. Authorities have identified the bird flu variant in question to be H5N1. This variant is the most common one in neighbouring countries but has not been found to cause infections in humans. MAST emphasizes that eating eggs or poultry is not thought to pose any risk of infection for humans. People are, however, cautioned about interacting with or touching sick or dead birds. The public is asked to report dead birds whose cause of death is clearly not an accident of some kind on the MAST website so the agency can determine if samples and testing are needed. Following MAST’s announcement, RÚV reported that hens at a farm in Skeiða (the town where the infected raven was found) showed symptoms of the bird flu and were slaughtered as a result. Samples were taken from the culled poultry and sent for testing; results were still pending at time of writing. Poultry farmers and bird owners are urged to keep their birds under a roof and fenced in, so as to prevent infection from wild birds.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
108,Iceland Review,Strongest Earthquake Swarm Since December,2022/04/13,"The Reykjanes peninsula in Southwest Iceland experienced its strongest earthquake swarm since December yesterday evening. The swarm began at 9:20 PM last night with an earthquake measuring M3.9. The swarm was already calming down by this morning and there is no sign of volcanic unrest in the area. The swarm’s first earthquake proved to be its strongest, though six other quakes measuring over M3 were recorded between 9:20 PM and 12:35 AM last night. All of them originated just northeast of Reykjanestá. “This is a typical swarm in this area, basically considering how they’ve been in the past two years,” Einar Bessi Gestsson, a natural hazard specialist at the Icelandic Met Office, told RÚV early this morning. The earthquake swarm is a fair distance west from the Geldingadalir eruption site, and there are no signs of volcanic unrest.

109,Iceland Review,Record Precipitation in Reykjavík Last Month,2022/04/06,"March was unusually wet and snowy across South, Southeast, and West Iceland this year, with record amounts of precipitation in several locations. Precipitation in Reykjavík last month measured three times the monthly average between 1991 and 2020, and was more than has ever been recorded for the month of March. The data is from the Icelandic Met Office’s monthly weather review. Precipitation in Reykjavík last month measured 209.5 mm, making it the wettest/snowiest March since weather monitoring began. March 1923 is in second place, with 183.2 mm. March 2022 had heavy precipitation even compared to other months of the year. Monthly precipitation has only been measured higher four times in Reykjavík: in November 1993, February 1921, January 1907, and November 1958. January 1842 and December 1843 were also exceptionally rainy, but the measurements for those months are unconfirmed. Considering the amount of rain and snow, it’s not surprising that March was not particularly sunny in the nation’s capital. Reykjavík only had 68.5 hours of sunshine last month, which is 41.8 hours below the March average between 1991 and 2020. Akureyri, North Iceland, on the other hand, had 112.1 sunshine hours in March, which is 34.3 hours more than the average for that month between the same time frame. Akureyri has not experienced a March with as much sunshine since 1996. Reykjavík had 14 snowy days last month, five more than average; while Akureyri experienced 11, which is five fewer than average between the years 1991 and 2020.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
110,Iceland Review,Earthquake Swarm on Reykjanes Does Not Mark Magma Intrusion,2022/04/05,"There is no reason to believe that the recent earthquake swarm on Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula marks a magma intrusion under the surface, tweeted Kristín Jónsdóttir, a Natural Hazard Specialist at the Icelandic Met Office. The swarm began on April 3 in Southwest Iceland, near the site of the recent Geldingadalir eruption, which lasted between March and September 2021. Some 200 earthquakes were recorded, with the biggest measuring M3.3. A larger swarm occurred on the Reykjanes peninsula last December, even closer to the eruption site, likely due to a magma intrusion. Thousands of earthquakes were detected at the site over several days, with several above M4 and the largest measuring M4.8. While the most recent earthquake swarm was not associated with a magma intrusion, Kristín says that there may be more intrusions and even eruptions in the area in the coming years. “I find it likely that we will be seeing repeated intrusions on the peninsula in the coming years, triggering earthquakes and that some will result in eruptions,” Kristín has stated.

111,Iceland Review,Forests Now Cover 2% of Iceland,2022/04/04,"Forests and bushes now cover over 2% of Iceland, Vísir reports. That number may not seem like much, but since 1990, the surface area covered by forest or shrubs in Iceland has increased more than six times over – from 7,000 hectares to 45,000. In 20 years, the number is expected to be 2.6%. The Icelandic Forestry Association (IFA) held a conference last week where the milestone was celebrated. “This is big news,” stated Arnór Snorrason, a forester at the IFA research station at Mógilsá. It’s not only forestry efforts that have increased these numbers, but also Iceland’s remaining natural birch forests, which Arnór says have finally begun expanding for the first time since Iceland was settled.

112,Iceland Review,March the Wettest Month on Record in Reykjavík,2022/03/29,"March will see a record amount of rain in Reykjavík, Mbl.is reports. As of yesterday, 209 mm of rainfall had been recorded in Iceland’s capital since the beginning of the month. After a season of extremes, it is clear that the month of March in Reykjavík will be the wettest in recorded history. According to meteorologist Trausti Jónsson, the MET Office had recorded 209 mm of rainfall in the capital city since the beginning of the month, Mbl.is reports. March 1923 had previously been dubbed “the wettest in recorded history,” when 183.2 mm of rainfall was recorded in Reykjavík. Although more rain is expected in the capital region during the final days of March, it will not fall in copious amounts, Trausti predicts. It is rare for rainfall to exceed 200 mm during a single month in Reykajvík. The last time this happened was in 2016 when 206.9 mm of rainfall was recorded. The official countrywide record is 259.7 mm, registered in November 1993. In January 1842, however, 291 mm of rainfall was recorded – but 19th-century measurements are generally considered unreliable, Trausti notes. Rainfall has been measured continuously in Reykjavík since 1920, although measurements conducted between 1884 and 1907 are considered relatively accurate. Rainfall was also measured between 1829 and 1854, although figures from that time may be unreliable. Rain has fallen in other parts of the country besides Reykjavík, although no records are expected to be broken in North Iceland. Continuous measurements have been conducted in Akureyri since 1928. Meteorologists have recorded 46.5 mm of rainfall in the town since March, which is just above average. In Stykkishólmur, rain has been measured almost without interruption since 1856, and it is quite unlikely that March will see a record amount of rain there – despite a total of 160.5 mm having been registered so far (the most recorded since 1974); in March 1948, 226.8 mm of rainfall was recorded in Stykkishólmur. Countrywide, March has also been, on average, slightly warmer compared to other years.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
113,Iceland Review,Rivers in Outer Reykjavík Flood Their Banks,2022/03/27,"The Elliðaár River flooded its banks in several places on Sunday afternoon, RÚV reports. The deluge comes in the wake of significant thawing this weekend, which has increased flow into rivers around the country. Daníel Freyr Jónsson, one of four geologists who manages the Facebook group Eldfjalla- og náttúruvárhópur Suðurlands (‘Volcano and natural hazards group of South Iceland’) documented the flooding. The Elliðaár river is fed by Lake Ellíðavatn on the eastern outskirts of Reykjavík. The river forks in the district of Árbær, where it bounds the Elliðaárdalur valley, a popular outdoor recreation area. Lake Ellíðavatn also feeds several other rivers, including the Bugða and Hólmsá rivers. According to the Met Office, flow into both the Bugða and Hólmsá rivers has increased significantly over the weekend; flow into the Hólmsá tripled in just over 24 hours between Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. Sunday’s flooding took place in the Víðidalur valley, not far from where Breiðhóltsvegur crosses the Elliðaár river. Large areas of vegetation and footpaths were also submerged around the Norðlingaholt neighbourhood and the Rauðhólar pseudo-craters where the Bugða river overflowed its banks as well. Eldfjalla- og náttúruvárhópur Suðurlands credits the flooding in Norðlingaholt in part to human intervention, as the pedestrian and horse bridge there significantly narrows the Bugða river. As of noon on Sunday, the water level of the Bugða river had almost reached the bridge floor.    ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
114,Iceland Review,Icelandic Company Plans to Recommence Whaling This Summer,2022/03/24,"Whaling company Hvalur hf. plans to recommence hunting whales this summer, after three years of no activity, Vísir reports. The company’s CEO Kristján Loftsson says fin whales will be the target and that market conditions for whale products are good. No whaling has taken place in Iceland since 2018, and the Minister of Fisheries has indicated the practice will be permanently stopped after 2023. Hvalur hf. plans to begin hunting in June and continue into September, according to Kristján. Some 150 employees are expected to staff the company’s whaling ships, whaling station in Hvalfjörður, West Iceland, and their processing plant in Hafnarfjörður. Kristján stated that the main reason for the company’s lack of activity in recent years is conflict with the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority concerning the company’s whaling station. He has previously cited poor market conditions and COVID-19 for the decision. Whaling licences in Iceland are issued for periods of a few years at a time. In a column published in Morgunblaðið last month, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated that there was little justification to permit whaling in Iceland after the current licence expires in 2023. There is little evidence that whaling is economically beneficial to Iceland, the Minister stated, adding that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. Hvalur hf. is Iceland’s main whaling company, and has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years. Public outcries followed when the company killed a pregnant fin whale and a rare hybrid whale in 2018. Hvalur hf. was at risk of losing their whaling licence after failing to submit captains’ logs for the 2014, 2015, and 2018 seasons. The company has been sued by three of its shareholders as well as by activists.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
115,Iceland Review,Oil Spill in Westfjords Cleaned Up,2022/03/22,"The diesel oil that leaked from a reserve tank into Suðureyri harbour, in the Westfjords, has now been cleaned up, RÚV reports. The location will be monitored to determine whether there is still contamination once the snow melts. Over 9,000 litres of diesel oil spilt into Suðureyri harbour on Thursday, March 3, more than two weeks ago. The leak, which originated from a reserve tank owned by the power company Orkubú Vestfjarða – and which was buried in snow – was discovered by residents the following morning. The oil found its way into a pond near the local swimming pool, and from there into the harbour. It wasn’t until three days after the leak was reported that hoses were placed in the water to try to prevent the leak from spreading. The oil was particularly harmful to local birdlife: hundreds of eider ducks died or had to be put down as a result of the oil, though some were saved thanks to locals’ efforts. Sigríður Kistinsdóttir, team leader of pollution prevention at the Environment Agency of Iceland, says cleaning of the pond and harbour has gone well and will be completed this weekend. Stormy weather has also helped disperse the oil, she added. A town meeting will be held in Suðureyri this week, where representatives of Orkubú Vestfjarða and the Westfjords Public Health Authority will be present.

Other migratory bird species, including white-fronted geese and pink-footed geese, have been spotted returning to their nesting grounds in small groups. Iceland is a key breeding area for many bird species: one-third of the world’s golden plovers, for example, breed on the island. This winter has been a particularly snowy and stormy one across Iceland. A series of storms hit the country last month, bringing record snowfall to the Reykjavík area.

117,Iceland Review,Another Low Front Expected This Weekend in East Iceland,2022/03/19,"A yellow weather alert will be in effect for northeastern Iceland from late Saturday afternoon and until early Sunday morning. Iceland Review spoke to a meteorologist at the Icelandic MET Office yesterday to inquire about the storm – and the inordinate number of lows that have passed through Iceland this winter. (The interview has been edited for length and clarity.) “Are the storms finally over?” I inquire, in a tone of hollow hopefulness, of meteorologist Óli Þór Árnason with the Icelandic MET Office. Thursday saw yet another yellow weather warning in the capital area (my mother-in-law’s flight to Ísafjörður was cancelled). “Well, no, that’s the simple answer,” he replies. “We’ll have another low front Saturday evening, and it’ll last into the morning. The weather will be quite divided. You’ll have sharp southerlies and warm temperatures to the east – exactly what you’d like to see here in the south, to get rid of the snow, you know? – and then you’ll have slow-moving northerly winds in the south and west of the country.” “Hmmm,” I say, taking notes. “It’ll be black and white – and I’ll let you decide which part is black and which part is white.” “Thank you so much for that, for respecting independent journalism. Listen, doesn’t this bother you?” “Yes, no, you know I’d like to see a little more spring in the weather. Less south-westerly winds and less hail. If that was the case, it wouldn’t be much of a problem.” “You know, this is the first time in my life that the weather has really bothered me. Like really bothered me. I’m 36 years old, but for the first time in my life, I’m exasperated.” “It was like this all the time before the turn of the century. This kind of weather was much more common back then. Probably your memory’s playing tricks on you.” “Maybe you’re right; I was in the States from 97 to 2002 – and then in the early ‘90s as well.” “Yes, it’s not exactly advisable, making such comparisons.” “So, let me get this straight, none of this is bothering you at all?” “No, I’m fine, pretty much. March can be a little tricky, but then the low fronts start subsiding. The main motor for these storms, that cold puddle just west of Greenland, which has been quite active in feeding this kind of weather, is gradually getting warmer. And you can feel it. There are changes in the air. The sun’s climbing higher.” “But things don’t look great, in the long-term, do they?” “You mean like global-warming?” “Yes, that’s what I mean.” “Well, we won’t be breeding crocodiles in Iceland anytime soon if that’s what you mean. But, yes, there’ll be more heat and more humidity. More bursts of precipitation. The best indicator of global warming is the fact that the alcohol content of certain wines is rising, because they’re growing at higher temperatures.” “Thank you, for your time.

119,Iceland Review,Cars With Studded Tires Pollute 40 Times More,2022/03/16,"Studded tires are a major factor in particulate pollution, RÚV reports. Þorsteinn Jóhansson, an expert at the Environment Agency of Iceland, presented the data in an open meeting today on the impact of studded tires on air quality and road surfaces. “A car with studded tires wears down [the road] many times over compared to a car without studded tires. That is 20-40 times more. That is not 20-40% more, rather at least 2000% more,” Þorsteinn stated. High levels of particulate pollution occur regularly in Reykjavík in the spring, when the weather is still, road surfaces are dry, and drivers have not yet switched over to summer tires. While Þorsteinn stated that it is clearly in the interest of those responsible for road maintenance to reduce the use of studded tires, he admitted that the need for such tires varies. “Especially people who live out in the countryside or people who are driving from Selfoss over Hellisheiði. There will certainly be days when it is better to be on studded tires, such as when there is wet ice, then studded tires have the advantage.” He pointed out that in Norway, a studded tire tax has been imposed to reduce their negative impact. “Studded tires are not banned anywhere in Norway, but there are fees in certain towns, so it is each municipality that decides and there has been an economic incentive to reduce the use of studded tires.” Those who live in the countryside and drive into Oslo can buy a studded tire “passport,” which can be an annual, monthly, or daily pass. Þorsteinn believes such a system could work in Iceland. “If there is permission to charge, it would certainly only be municipalities in the capital area that would use it. Residents of Ísafjörður would never impose a fee for studded tires.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

121,Iceland Review,North Iceland Learning to Live With Rabbits,2022/03/14,"Those rascally rabbits! Though only relatively recently introduced to Icelandic nature, the rabbit population has laid down roots in many of the country’s forested areas. One arborist in North Iceland is conceding the only option now is to learn to live with the bunnies, RÚV reports. Ingólfur Jóhannsson, director of the Eyjafjörður Forestry Association, said that while efforts began in 2014 to eradicate the rabbit population in Akureyri’s Kjarnaskógur forest, he no longer considers them a plague. “These rabbits are here to stay, and we will not get rid of them,” he said. “We just have to learn to live with them.” Ingólfur told the state broadcaster the rabbits pose the biggest threat to saplings, and flowering trees and shrubs, like rose bushes and fruit trees. He has had to protect many plants — including a new cherry tree he’s growing — with chicken wire to keep the rabbits at bay. It’s not only in the woods that the bunnies are getting up to no good. An Akureyri greenhouse has had to install a rabbit security system that emits a high-pitched tone to deter the animals, in addition to erecting rabbit fencing around the property “If it crosses the fence, a rabbit can eat hundreds of plants in an hour,” said Sólskógar greenhouse employee Ásgeir Þór Ásgeirsson. “So there is a lot of financial damage if they get in.” While Akureyri’s environmental department is responsible for keeping the rabbit population in check and estimates that it shoots 3,000 rabbits per year, not everyone dislikes the furry little fellas. Akureyri residents told RÚV they enjoy seeing the rabbits while walking through the forest.

123,Iceland Review,"More Energy Needed to Ensure Green Transition, Government Report Indicates",2022/03/10,"Iceland will have to increase energy production by 125% in order to achieve a full transition to green energy, a new government report indicates. Iceland’s Environment Minister says the report can be used as a basis for decision making, but it is up to authorities how they apply the information provided. The CEO of the Icelandic Environment Association has stated that building additional power plants entails sacrificing Icelandic nature and is not a necessary step toward achieving the country’s environmental goals. “It’s clear that this is necessary if we are to achieve the energy transition, Iceland’s Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate, Guðlaugur Þór Guðluagsson, stated. “However, there are many ways to achieve that goal. And this is not a policy. It is, however, a status report and highlights how things stand. Now it is up to the Parliament and the government to work it out, how to best handle this issue.” The report proposes six scenarios for the future of energy production in Iceland, five of which entail increasing energy production. Only four scenarios assume that the country will achieve a full energy transition by 2040: that is, completely stop the use of fossil fuels within the next 18 years. If this goal is taken into account, and a rise in energy-intensive industry is assumed, then Iceland will need to produce 125% more energy than it does today. Ensuring those energy needs are met would not only require additional power plants, but increased efficiency at existing plants, energy-saving measures, and more efficient energy usage. Read More: Iceland’s Plan to Become Carbon Neutral by 2040 Energy production is also a key factor in innovation and job creation across Iceland, according to Sigríður Mogensen, a department head at the Federation of Icelandic Industries, and one of the authors of the government report. “Many projects have been in the works and in development, whether it is food production projects, biotechnology projects, algae cultivation, and I could go on, which have unfortunately not been possible due to a lack of electricity or the weak state of the electricity transmission system.” “It’s a question of what decisions we make. If this becomes a reality, then we’re making the decision to sacrifice Icelandic nature,” Auður Önnu Magnúsdóttir, CEO of the Icelandic Environment Association, stated in response to the report. She does not agree that a 125% hike in energy production is necessary in order to achieve a full energy transition. Auður has argued for “real energy-saving measures, such as diversifying tourism, coastal shipping, such as building passive buildings, using heat pumps, and taking real energy efficiency measures, such as using waste heat from power plants. Today, 80% of the energy that is produced, it goes directly to big industry. That is not sensible prioritising.”","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
124,Iceland Review,Snowiest February in Reykjavík Since 2000,2022/03/03,"The price tag for snow removal in the City of Reykjavík this February is expected to amount to ISK 300 million [$2.3 million; €2.1 million], roughly double the average cost for that month, Vísir reports. Snow plough operators say that consistent snowfall and thick ice on the roads have made the last month a challenge. This was the snowiest February in Reykjavík since the year 2000, according to the Icelandic Met Office. A series of storms hit Iceland last month, most bringing heavy precipitation. Snow and ice have accumulated in the streets of Reykjavík and snow plough operators have hardly been able to finish clearing the results of one snowfall before the next filled the streets yet again. Cumulative snowfall in Reykjavík last month amounted to 113.8 mm, which is 26% above the average for that month between 1991-2020. “It’s been a terrible time,” Hjalti Jóhannes Guðmundsson, office manager of land maintenance at the City of Reykjavík stated. “It’s snowed, it’s rained, it’s frozen over, and it’s snowed again. So we never really get to finish our project, to clear properly before the next snowfall begins. So we’ve had to take ploughs and equipment and manpower from the lowest priority in residential streets and put them back in other projects to just start all over again.” Many residential streets in the city have thus had to wait for ploughing as main thoroughfares are prioritised. Plough operator Þorkell Hjaltason says the ice that has formed on the streets has made snow removal particularly difficult. “This is totally new, at least now. It was more like this around 1980, when I was also ploughing. Then it was often like this. But we haven’t seen this in many years.” He says the conditions have exhausted staff in recent days. A banner on the City of Reykjavík website states that snow removal is “at full blast,” and urges residents who have comments on snow removal to use the webchat service, online submission form, or send an email, as the phone lines are busy. The banner notes that garbage collection is also behind schedule and asks residents to clear snow and spread salt or gravel around their garbage cans.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

The storm also cut off electricity to a number of traffic lights in the city. Not all areas of the capital were equally affected by the outages. In some areas, people only experienced lights flickering and dimming, followed by appliance outages around 4:00 pm. In the areas of Úlfarársdalur, Þormóðsdalur, and Hafravatn, however, electricity was completely out starting at 9:00 am and as of 5:00 pm, repairs had still not been made due to worsening weather conditions. Shortly before 5:00 pm, utilities provider Veitur announced that storms and lightning had created a number of service disruptions due to damage to their electrical systems and voltage drops. Almost all of Veitur’s water pumps, from Grundafjörður on the Snæfellsnes peninsula to the town of Hvolsvöllur on the South coast, stopped functioning due to these disruptions.

126,Iceland Review,"Flooding, Wind Damage, and Stranded Travellers in Last Night’s Storm",2022/02/22,"Gale-force winds and flooding kept firefighters, search and rescue teams, and other response crews busy across the Reykjavík capital area and Southwest Iceland last night. The storm swept a sports dome out to sea, ripped a bus shelter from its foundation, and caused flooding and transport trouble throughout the region. Weather has calmed slightly, though yellow and orange weather alerts remain in effect until this afternoon. Capital area firefighters responded to 25 calls due to weather and flooding last night, in addition to one fire and 30 medical transports, RÚV reports. One of the projects was securing a bus shelter that had ripped from its foundation in the Gravarvogur neighbourhood so that it would not be carried away by wind. The same was not possible for Hamarshöllin sports dome in Hveragerði, South Iceland, which was blown out to sea in the storm. Rain, snow, and meltwater caused flooding across the region, and firefighting crews spent much of the night pumping water from homes. Rescue crews transported around 100 people that had gotten stuck in their cars on Þrengslavegur road (Route 39) to an emergency response centre in Þorlákshöfn, Southwest Iceland. Their cars were left behind, to be transported once weather conditions improved. The response centre was set up by the Red Cross, which also assisted residents of Patreksfjörður, in the Westfjords, last night, who had to be evacuated from their homes due to the risk of avalanches. Twenty-eight were required to leave their homes in the town: 18 found accommodation with friends and family, while the remaining 10 were put up in a hotel.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

It’s possible that the warning level will be elevated to red in South Iceland, depending on how conditions develop. Ten-Year-Old Boy Rescued from Avalanche in Hveragerði A Search and Rescue team in Hveragerði, South Iceland was called out on Saturday afternoon to help rescue a ten-year-old boy who had been buried in snow. The boy had been playing with his 14-year-old brother at the base of a rock wall when the accumulated snow slid off the top and buried him. The boy’s brother acted quickly, locating his brother under the snow, digging away the snow to uncover his face, and calling the 112 emergency line for assistance. ICE-SAR arrived at the scene, finished unburying the boy, and transported him to the hospital in an ambulance. As of 2:00 pm, when the local police posted about the incident on Facebook, the boy was recovering well. Police reminded locals to be particularly cautious, as there was ongoing risk of avalanches in the area. Sixty Cars Stuck on Roadway near Sólheimasandur Heavy snowfall in South Iceland created even more trouble early Saturday evening. Nearly 60 cars became stuck on the road near the Sólheimasandur glacial outwash plain not far from the Jökulsá river. Some of the cars became stuck in the snow, and some of them were simply trapped behind the stuck cars. ICE-SAR was called out to dig the cars out and manage the ensuing traffic jam.

129,Iceland Review,Magma Intrusions Could Cause Serious Infrastructural Damage in Capital Area,2022/02/12,"Dike intrusions on the Reykjanes peninsula could potentially damage important infrastructure, both on the peninsula and in the capital area, RÚV reports. This per a Morgunblaðið interview with geoscientist Páll Einarson, who explained that regardless of whether they lead to a volcanic eruption or not, such intrusions could impact the geothermal systems that feed water and heating utilities, as well as geothermal power plants. A dike (also spelled dyke) is a kind of igneous, or magma intrusion, a “vertical or steeply-dipping sheets of igneous rock” that forms “as magma pushes up towards the surface through cracks in the rock.” Páll told interviewers that there have been magma intrusions in three or four places on Reykjanes that haven’t caused any serious problems, but one in the wrong place could do permanent infrastructural damage. Currently, there’s no sign that such an event is imminent but Páll explained the recent eruption of Fagradalsfjall in Geldingadalur valley is part of a complex chain of events on the peninsula. See Also: Odds of Eruption Decrease As New Data Suggests that Magma is Solidifying Underground A variety of scenarios are possible in the future, Páll continued, including volcanic activity on land or at sea, or intrusion activity around the Krýsuvík and Svartsengi geothermal areas, the Heiðmörk conservation area on the outskirts of Reykjavík, or the Bláfjöll mountains. Páll noted that eruptions on Reykjanes tend to be small to medium fissure eruptions, and added that the capital may yet experience intense earthquakes as part of this ongoing activity on the peninsula, but there’s no way to say when these might occur.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

134,Iceland Review,"Little Justification to Continue Whaling, Iceland’s Fisheries Minister Says",2022/02/04,"Svandís Svavarsdóttir, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries, stated there is little evidence that whaling is economically beneficial to Iceland. The current government regulations allows for whaling until the year 2023, and Svandís says she sees little reason to permit the practice after that licence expires. In a column published in Morgunblaðið newspaper today, Svandís points out that since whaling for commercial purposes was reintroduced in 2006, several hundred fin whales and a considerable number of minke whales have been killed. She states that it is undisputed that whaling is not of great economic importance. Over the past three years, only one minke whale has been killed, in 2021. The companies that had a licence to whale during these years chose not to do so. Svandís says there could be several reasons for that choice, “but perhaps the simple explanation is that sustained losses from this hunting is the most likely outcome.” The consumption of whale meat in Japan, Iceland’s main market for the product, is declining. The Minister also points out that whaling is a controversial practice, and this has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. Hvalur hf., Iceland’s main whaling company, has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years. Public outcries followed when the company killed a pregnant fin whale and a rare hybrid whale in 2018. Hvalur hf. was at risk of losing their whaling licence after failing to submit captains’ logs for the 2014, 2015, and 2018 seasons. The company has been sued by three of its shareholders as well as by activists. Svandís stated that the government would carry out an assessment on the potential economic and social impact of whaling this year.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
135,Iceland Review,Reduction of Capelin Quota May Be Necessary,2022/02/03,"New measurements of capelin stocks from the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) suggest that it might be necessary to reduce capelin quotas for the ongoing season by around 100,000 tonnes. This year’s quota was set at 904,200 tonnes and has not been higher in decades. MFRI’s final decision is expected by mid-February. In October 2021, the MFRI set a capelin catch quota for the 2021-2022 season at 904,000 tonnes following the autumn research expeditions. This quota was sevenfold that of the previous season’s quota, and a dramatic shift from 2019 and 2020, when no capelin catch quota was issued at all. The total landings of the 2020-2021 fishing year amounted to about 128,600 tonnes, among the lowest catches since 1980. Still, its export value amounted to 20 billion ISK [$154,500,000, €133,140,000]. Research vessels Árni Friðriksson and Bjarni Sæmundsson recently completed an expedition to assess the state of capelin stocks. The data collected suggest a total catch quota of 800,000 tonnes, which would be a 11% reduction from the previously issued quota. The recommendation is based on measurements taken off the Northeast, East, and Southeast coasts. Sea ice delayed measurements in the Westfjords region, which are expected to be done next week. A final quota recommendation will be issued after that expedition is complete. Capelin fishing has gone well this season, with two ships breaking records for the largest ever catch in Iceland.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0

The decision is based on proposals from the Environment Agency of Iceland. This is 199 fewer reindeer than last year, primarily due to uncertainty about reindeer counts due to weather conditions and the movement of animals between hunting areas during the count. Bull (male reindeer) hunting season is from August 1 to September 15. Cows (female reindeer) may be hunted between August 1 and September 20. During the first two weeks of the season, hunters are required to avoid killing cows that are suckling, in order to minimise the impact hunting has on calves. Hunting guides are responsible for assisting and guiding hunters in their selection of prey. Icelandic regulations forbid the hunting of calves and bulls under two years of age.

139,Iceland Review,"Residents, Landvernd Protest Proposed Land Reclamation and Development Project",2022/01/30,"Both residents of the Skerjafjörður neighbourhood in Reykjavík and Landvernd, the Icelandic Environment Association, have levelled strong protests against the City of Reykjavík’s proposal for a new, 4.3-hectare [10.6-acre] land extension to a stretch of local shoreline known by some locals as Shell Beach, Fréttablaðið reports. The city argues the extension is necessary to support a proposed adjoining residential neighbourhood, ‘New Skerjafjörður,’ which will be home to as many as 1,300 new residents. But opponents say that such development plans would increase pollution and traffic, as well as destroy a unique ecosystem and popular recreational area. Per the city’s 95-page report on the proposed project, land fill would be used to build up a 700-meter [.43-mi] stretch of the existing beach and also extend the shore 100 meters further into the sea. However, the site is currently home to mudflats which are protected under nature conservation law. The city contends that the mudflats would not be destroyed but rather would be able to regenerate after the initial construction. “The coastline will be shaped such that it looks like a natural beach and endeavours will be made to ensure that mudflats can reform in place of those that will be disturbed,” reads the report. The project is said to be “…part of the densification of populated areas and the construction of new neighbourhoods in the southwestern part of the city, in accordance with the Reykjavík Municipal Plan, 2010 – 2030.” The area is very popular amongst walkers and cyclists but although there would be some disruption to these activities while the landfill is created, the city says, the disruption would be not be significant and will allow for new paths and recreational areas to be built on the site. See Also: City Council Approves New 102 Reykjavík Postcode
 The project was posted and open for public comment until January 25th. During this period, it received considerable negative feedback from constituents. “It should be clear to everyone that the land reclamation and planned structures will have a significant and negative impact on the landscape and its appearance,” wrote Landvernd in a public comment on the project. The association said that the project will result in a “man-made stone structure…it’s difficult to make a convincing argument for the societal need to spoil mudflats like these, which there are few left of in the capital area.” Another commenter on the project was engineer Sigurður Áss Grétarsson, who worked for the Icelandic Road Administration for a long time and also oversaw the construction of the Landeyjahöfn harbour in South Iceland. Citing a report by a city conservationist, Sigurður noted that the beach has remained largely unchanged since the 19th century, and hasn’t already been disturbed, as the city has suggested. He also said that the proposed undersea wall that is supposed to help with the regeneration of the mudflats is too narrow to actually break waves and do any good. “If the intention is to destroy the mudflats, then the city should just say it straight out,” he wrote, “instead of being deceptive and throwing dust in people’s eyes.” See Also: New Neighbourhood By Reykjavík Airport to Prioritise Pedestrians
 At time of writing, an online petition to “Save Skerjafjörður” had 528 signatures. “The proposed site is one of the few remaining natural areas in Reykjavik [sic],” reads the petition text. “It is one of the few such areas easily accessible to lower-income residents of the city (i.e. those without cars) such as the students in the nearby dormitories and newly built housing complexes. Tourists and summer visitors enjoy this small bay, whose clay bottom makes it a unique ecosystem, unlike the rocky shore that borders it, one of the few remaining bits of natural shore in the city. It is among the first areas to provide a sheltered home to migratory birds (the oyster-catchers and golden plover have already arrived). School groups, cyclists, and marathon runners appreciate the beauty of the path through this area. At no time have more people enjoyed it than in this time of Covid. Once destroyed, this charming natural shore can never be re-created. Human attempts to ‘rebuild’ natural scenerios [sic] are doomed to failure.” The petition also calls into question the new residential neighborhood, which, the petitioners say, “will put even more stress on existing streets that can barely handle the traffic they have to deal with, and the cars will add to the pollution in a city that already has too much.” They question whether so many people would even want to live in New Skerjafjörður, as the plans for the neighborhood were developed prior to the COVID pandemic, which “has made a lot of people re-think their ideas about where and how it is best to live, and companies re-think the possibilities of having employees work at home. It is no longer necessary that everyone live as close as possible to their place of employment, or that these places of employment be centrally located.” There are also future risks to consider, write the petitioners. “In times of climate change, any building along the coast is unadvisable [sic]. With rising sea-levels, coastal buildings will be at risk of flooding within a generation or two.” The period for public comment on the project has now closed.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
140,Iceland Review,‘Blue Blob’ Is Slowing Icelandic Glacier Melt — For Now,2022/01/29,"Icelandic glaciers have been losing mass since the Little Ice Age, but that process has slowed over the last decade thanks to the influence of what scientists have dubbed the Blue Blob, “an area of regional cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean to the south of Greenland,” Euronews reports. This was among the findings in a new study authored by Icelandic and Dutch scientists, who also project that the slowdown is only temporary. When less snow accumulates on glaciers in the winter than melts in the summer, this is called Negative Surface Mass Balance, or SMB, which in turn, causes sea levels to rise. In Iceland, this process accelerated at the start of the 21st century but has slowed down considerably since 2011. This is particularly surprising because loss of mass has not slowed down for glaciers in nearby Arctic areas—most notably the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has been identified as the single greatest contributor to rising sea levels. In the span of 12 months alone, from August 2020 to August 2021, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost close to 166 billion tonnes of ice. In the course of their research, the Icelandic-Dutch team noted that the slower rate at which Icelandic glaciers have been losing mass coincided with the emergence of the Blue Blob. As Iceland is “more exposed to the ocean and maritime influences than Greenland,” the scientists say that it now “appears that a cooler convection of air from the blue blob has kept [Icelandic] glaciers more intact. The mystery of the Blue Blob
 The Blue Blob is a mystery in and of itself, and one which scientists have sought to explain for years. Over the last 100 years, global temperatures have risen by an average of 1°C, but at the same time, the temperature of the Blue Blob has dropped, in almost direct proportion, by .9°C. One hypothesis for this is that the North Atlantic current has gotten weaker, which means that Nordic waters are getting less of an infusion of warm water from the tropics. Back in 2016, Norwegian climate researcher Peter Langen offered quite a simple explanation: the blob came into being during a very cold winter, he said, “and the cold actually resulted in an increased mixing of surface water with the deeper levels.” Most recently, in 2020, it was postulated that human-created factors caused the cold spot, namely low-level clouds that deflect sunlight. Whatever its origin, the Blue Blob’s effect on Icelandic glaciers is clear. But while it has slowed SMB in Iceland’s glaciers for now, scientists say this won’t last forever. The research team conducted climate modeling that took into account both satellite images and fieldwork findings. Their model showed that there will be a short window in the 2040s when Icelandic glaciers “actually go back to an SMB of zero,” but by the 2050s, “global warming will flip the narrative.” Icelandic glaciers could lose up to a third of their volume by end of 21st century The Blue Blob will eventually stop cooling, the scientists say, and at that point, Icelandic glacier ice will begin to melt even faster. If there is no intervention to curb climate change, by the end of the 21st century, Icelandic glaciers will have lost a third of their total volume. And this could easily have “disastrous consequences around the world.” The projections are not entirely without hope, however. “The Arctic is warming fast, and it can be difficult to live with” lead author Brice Noël, a post-doc researcher at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research in Utrecht, told Euronews. “But climate projections give us trajectories that enable us to see what needs to be done to try and mitigate glacier melt.” See the full study (in English) here.          ","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0

The aim is to gather data on how various bird species in Iceland are faring while raising the public’s awareness of the environment. Today Friday, January 28, marks the beginning of the annual Birdwatch Weekend (lasting until Monday, January 31), which is sponsored by BirdLife Iceland. During the event, the public is encouraged to spend one hour observing and registering the species of bird visible in their yards (along with noting the most numerous species) before submitting their data online. “We’re talking the annual Garden Birdwatch weekend,” Anna María Lind Geirsdóttir, publicity officer with BirdLife Iceland, stated in an interview with RÚV, noting that the event has been held in January since 2004. According to Anna María, the purpose of the campaign is twofold: on the one hand, to raise awareness of the environment and nature, and, on the other hand, to monitor how particular bird species in Iceland are faring. As noted on its website, BirdLife Iceland also promotes a more extensive survey that lasts the entire winter. This survey has been held since 1994. Seventy-four bird species have been seen in the survey since then. Redwing, snow bunting, raven, redpoll, common blackbird, and starling are the most common garden birds in Iceland. “Of course, we’d like more people to participate in the big survey that is in effect all winter, but with these weekend campaigns, we’re hoping that people realise that participating takes very little effort,” Anna María added.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0

143,Iceland Review,Sprat: New Fish Species Breeding Off Iceland’s Coast,2022/01/24,"Researchers have confirmed that the fish species sprat is spawning in Icelandic waters, according to a new report from Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute. Sprat has been found in significant numbers off the south and west coast and spawned near Ísafjarðardjúp fjord in the Westfjords last year. Sprat first appeared near the Icelandic coast in 2017, and its numbers have been increasing since.  Probably originate from Faroese waters As seen in the picture above, sprat is not dissimilar to herring, a commercial species important in Iceland’s fishing industry. It has likely reproduced in more locations than just near Ísafjarðardjúp, according to the report. Over the past few years, Icelandic vessels have fished the species in greater numbers. The most likely explanation for the appearance of sprat is that sprat larvae were carried to Icelandic waters by ocean currents before hatching near the coast of Iceland. Approximately 1,000 tonnes of sprat was fished by Faroese vessels in 2020, and the larvae likely originated from Faroese waters; however, no eggs, larvae, or mature sprat have been found in the waters between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, says Jón Sólmundsson, an ichthyologist with the Marine & Freshwater Research Institute, and who recently authored an article on sprat in the magazine Náttúrufræðingurinn.  Even though sprat was first fished near Iceland in 2017, Jón believes that the species had been fished by Icelandic fishing vessels earlier, given its similarity in appearance to young herring.  Only time will tell Sprat is the common name applied to a group of forage fish belonging to the genus Sprattus in the family Clupeidae. Sprat is a highly active, small, oily fish, which travels in sizeable schools with other fish and swims continuously throughout the day. According to Jón, it is unclear whether sprat will begin to breed near the Icelandic coast more permanently; water temperature and other environmental factors will determine whether sprat will become an important species within Icelandic fishing grounds.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

See Also: Looking Back: The Fateful Year of 1918 Friday also marked 104 years since the coldest temperatures ever recorded in Iceland. The winter of 1917-18 is known in Iceland as Frostaveturinn mikla, the Great Frost Winter. During this terrible winter, temperatures plummeted and sea ice formed around Iceland, closing off vital shipping routes and exacerbating existing shortages of vital goods. The month of January 1918 was particularly devastating, and on January 21, temperatures plummeted lower than they ever had or have done since: -24.5°C [-12.1°F] in Reykjavík, and, in Northeast Iceland, -36°C [-32.8°F] at Grímsstaðir and -38°C [-36.4°F] at Möðrudalur.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
145,Iceland Review,Almost One Thousand Orcas Identified in Icelandic Waters,2022/01/22,"A new photo catalog has identified 987 individual orcas (also known colloquially as killer whales), primarily in the area around the Snæfellsnes peninsula in West Iceland. The catalog is the culmination of a ten-year project undertaken by whale watching tour guide and Orca Guardians founder Marie-Thérèse Mrusczok, in cooperation with the West Iceland Nature Research Center. “An overall aim of our year-round identification work both from land and sea is to record as many individual killer whales as possible moving through the area, with as few knowledge gaps as possible, extending fieldwork over the longest achievable period of time,” reads the report introduction. “This will help identify potential critical habitat / important feeding grounds of the Icelandic orca population and provide crucial knowledge for conservation measures. Furthermore, collecting data (and an average of 40,000 photographs) in the same area throughout the year gives unique insights into migration patterns, social structure, and feeding habits of repeatedly documented individuals. The catalogue is thus used as a tool to aid in conservation work, for the long-term monitoring of the population, and as a reference document for ongoing and future research.” The orcas represented in the catalog were photographed during whale watching tours made around Snæfellsnes from 2011 – 2021. Marie-Thérèse then analyzed the 330,000 resulting photos, using the shape, size, and scarring on the animals’ dorsal fins as points of reference, “as well as shape, pigmentation, and scarring patterns of the saddle patch (brighter skin area below and behind the dorsal fin).” Every orca has a unique set of these identifying characteristics. Whenever possible, the catalog includes both a left- and right-side dorsal photograph of each orca, along with their tag number. Some of the orcas even have names: Butterfly, Blackout, D’Artagnan, Thor, Minotaurus, Kaktus, Mrs. Torrance, Redrum, Raggabagga, Díva, Detour, Dave, Scruffles, Ívar, Lionheart, Grettir, Vagabond, Ebenezer, Mister Wriggle, Hangover, Nixie, Elena, Ashfall. Most of the photographs were taken around Snæfellsnes and, as such, the vast majority of identifications, or 961 whales, were made in that area. Marie-Thérèse then augmented the Snæfellsnes data with photos taken in Steingrímsfjörður, Ísafjörður and Látrabjarg in the Westfjords; Skjálfandi Bay in the North; Borgarfjörður eystri in the East, and areas further east of Iceland; Hvalfjörður, the waters south of Grindavík, and Faxaflói Bay in the Southwest near Reykjavík; and the waters south of Vík in the South of Iceland. This additional data made it possible to identify an additional 26 whales, bringing the full catalog total to 987. The current photographic catalog is far more extensive than the one that came before it in 2017, which only identified 322 whales. This is not a result of a jump in orca population, the report clarifies, but rather improved documentation and observation. The identification project is ongoing, and so the catalog will continue to be updated in the future. The full report is available (in English) via pdf on the Orca Guardians website, here.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
146,Iceland Review,Genetic Jackpot: the Icelandic Sheep that Could Eradicate Scrapie,2022/01/18,"Six sheep on the farm Þernunes in Reyðarfjörður, East Iceland, hold the key to eradicating the fatal disease scrapie from the country. RÚV reports that the sheep carry a gene that is recognised by the European Union to protect against the disease. This is the first time the genotype has been found in Iceland, and could be pivotal to winning the fight against the disease, which has plagued Icelandic farms for over a century. The genotype, known as ARR, has never before been found in Iceland, despite great efforts from researchers. Another genotype known to protect sheep from scrapie, known as T137, was also recently found in at least four Icelandic sheep. Extensive research in Italy has found that T137 protects sheep from scrapie, but it is not officially recognised by the EU as the ARR genotype. Scrapie is a degenerative and fatal disease that affects sheep. Because it is highly contagious and can persist in flocks for decades, a flock in which the disease is discovered must be culled. Within the European Union, sheep that carry the AAR genotype do not need to be culled, even when scrapie is diagnosed within their flock, as research shows the gene protects them from both contracting and transmitting the disease. Read More: Dream of a Scrapie-Free Iceland Researchers sequenced 4,200 DNA samples from sheep around Iceland and sheep in Greenland that were of Icelandic origin. The six sheep in Reyðarfjörður that carry the gene trace their lineage to Reykhólasveit and Strandir, in the Westfjords, giving researchers hope the ARR genotype is to be found elsewhere in Iceland. Researchers plan to analyse DNA samples from some 15,000 sheep this winter to determine whether they carry the genotype. The ARR genotype could eradicate scrapie through careful breeding. Researchers say, however, that it will be a challenge to spread the genotype through the population as quickly as possible without reducing diversity in the Icelandic sheep stock.","Nature,Sci&Tech,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
147,Iceland Review,Hundreds of Dead Guillemots Found on East Iceland Beaches,2022/01/15,"Nearly three hundred guillemots were found dead along the coasts of Iceland’s East Fjords last week, RÚV reports. Based on their appearance, it’s assumed that the birds died of starvation. The East Iceland Nature Research Centre searched from Berjufjörður to Reyðarfjörður and found 273 guillemot carcasses. However, this is most likely only a fraction of the total number of birds that have actually died of late, said ornithologist Hálfdán Helgi Helgason, as in cases like this, only a small number of carcasses tend to wash ashore. Hálfdán Helgi noted that seabirds like guillemots often have trouble finding food in bad weather and Iceland’s been subjected to a spate of storms of late. It is also possible that some birds were injured by hunters, as a great deal of seabird hunting has taken place in the East Fjords since the fall. It’s unlikely that bird flu is behind the deaths, but this possibility has not been entirely ruled out. The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority has been sent samples for further investigation and Hálfdán said he will continue to monitor the situation locally. He encourages anyone who lives in the area and finds a dead or dying bird on a seashore to report it to the centre.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
148,Iceland Review,Coastal Fishermen Unhappy With Reduced Cod Quota,2022/01/12,"Small boat fishermen in Iceland are unhappy with the government’s decision to reduce their cod fishing quota from 10,000 tonnes down to 8,500 for the coming summer season, Vísir reports. Arthúr Bogason, chairman of the National Union of Small Boat Owners (Landssamband smábátaeigenda) says the government has not provided any data to support the decision and hopes it will be reconsidered. A meeting with Fisheries Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir on the matter was inconclusive. Arthúr says he does not know whether the decision to reduce the quota was made in the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture or by the Directorate of Fisheries (Fiskistofa) but the union is working to find out. However, since the decision was made on December 21, the phone at the union office has not stopped ringing. He adds that the Left-Green Movement, the party to which Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Svandís Svavarsdóttir belongs, has supported coastal fishermen in the past and worked to improve their conditions. The decision comes across as change of direction from the party. Arthúr brought up the issue in a meeting with Svandís one week ago. He stated that although the discussion went well and the union expects fruitful collaboration with the incoming minister. Last year a total of 670 fishermen held coastal fishing licences. Coastal fishing is not an easy job, according to Arthúr, but the number of fishermen in the field has remained relatively steady since 2009, when the current regulations governing coastal fishing were implemented. The regulations permit all fishermen to fish in coastal waters provided they fulfill certain requirements, which Arthúr describes as extensive. “Certain politicians predicted [coastal fishing] would explode. That thousands would sign up and it was best avoided.” However, since the current system was implemented, the number of fishermen has fluctuated between 600 and 726, according to Arthúr. “While handline fishing is romantic, there’s a lot of hard work and sweat and tears mixed in with the romance,” he stated.","Business,Nature,Politics",1,0,1,1,0,0
149,Iceland Review,Sheep With Rare Genotype Could Eradicate Scrapie,2022/01/11,"Sheep that carry special genes could hold they key to eradicating the fatal disease scrapie from Iceland, RÚV reports. The ewes Tignarleg, located on a farm in Northwest Iceland, and Móbotna, on a farm in the northeast, both carry a rare gene that protects them against the fatal, degenerative disease. So far, four ewes that carry the gene have been found in the Icelandic sheep stock, but no rams. The findings are part of an international study that is providing hope that scrapie could be eradicated from Iceland within the next decade. The Icelandic Agricultural Advisory Centre is taking part in the study alongside experts from Germany, England, and Italy. Guðfinna Harpa Árnadóttir, chairperson of the National Association of Sheep Farmers and a farmer herself, says that the genotype, known as T137, has been found to protect sheep against scrapie in three large Italian studies. “So we have hopes that the same applies to the scrapie that has been plaguing us here in Iceland. But it is yet to be confirmed by further research. But it’s very exciting, at the least, to find that genotype,” Guðfinna stated.  Read More: Dream of a Scrapie-Free Iceland May Become a Reality Móbotna, who belongs to Guðfinna, not only carries the rare genotype, but also sports rare colouring and has four horns. Guðfinna says researchers are seeking out sheep with unusual characteristics, as it might indicate they are more likely to carry rare genes. “Hopefully we’ll find more exciting animals that can help us in this fight against scrapie. Of course, in continuation, a breeding plan will be made, about how we plan to cultivate [the genotype] further.” Scrapie is believed to have arrived in Iceland via an English ram that was transported to Skagafjörður fjord in 1878. It is a fatal, degenerative disease with no treatment or cure and it is highly contagious (between sheep). The prion that causes it can persist in soil and flocks for decades. Scrapie is not transmissible to humans.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
150,Iceland Review,Food and Veterinary Authority Refers Mare Abuse Incident to Police,2022/01/08,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) has completed its investigation of the mistreatment of Icelandic mares during blood collection procedures. Per a press release on its website, the agency has determined that the abuse, which was caught by hidden camera and featured in a YouTube documentary called “Iceland – Land of 5,000 Blood Mares,” constitutes a breach of animal welfare laws. The incident and all related evidence have been turned over to the police. See Also: MAST Reviewing Footage of Mistreated Mares in YouTube Doc The documentary was posted in November 2021 by Tierschutzbund Zürich (TSB, Switzerland) and the Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF, Germany) and has since received almost 70,500 views. It reports on the activities within so-called “blood farms” in Iceland, where blood is drawn from mares in early pregnancy to extract ECG (previously known as pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin or PMSG): a hormone commonly used in concert with progestogens to induce ovulation in livestock prior to artificial insemination. The documentary features footage from hidden cameras showing workers beating and shouting at horses. The filmmakers claim to have discovered “widespread animal-welfare violations” in Iceland, which run counter to claims made by pharmaceutical companies on the nature of blood-collection procedures in the country. See Also: Blood Harvesting in Mares Four Times More Frequent Than a Decade Ago In the course of its investigation, MAST contacted both TSB and AWF and requested further information on where and when the video footage had been taken, as well as whatever uncut footage was available. MAST says that in December, it received an open letter from the organizations in which they refused to share uncut footage or confirm filming locations, although they did specify the dates on which the footage had been shot. Experts at MAST reviewed the documentary footage in detail and were able to determine both the location of the incidents as well as the people involved. The agency sought explanations from the individuals in question and their responses to the video footage. However, although MAST was able to confirm that abuses had taken place, the agency says that without all of the footage, including the uncut material that TSB and AWF refuse to provide, it is limited in its ability to assess the seriousness of the violations or to investigate the case in full.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
151,Iceland Review,One-Man Reforestation Project To Restore Pre-Settlement Woodland,2022/01/07,"For thousands of years before Iceland was settled, the majority of the country’s lowland areas and parts of the highlands were covered in birch forests. While patches of the original woodlands still exist and have grown larger following protection against grazing sheep along with warmer climate, most of the country is now famously devoid of trees and forests. Spurred on by the UN sending out a “rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems all around the world” in the form of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, biologist Atli Jósefsson has taken it upon himself to try to reclaim at least a small patch of the country’s ancient vegetation. The Mosfellsheiði heath consists of what many Icelanders consider a typical rural landscape. Mossy hummocks covered with ling, interspersed with rocky areas of exposed soil. Yet even into the 18th century, patches of the original birch forest remained. Grazing livestock contributed to soil erosion in the past but these days, a portion of the area is fenced-off, keeping the offending sheep at bay. It’s here that Atli is realising his one-man mission to reclaim at least one part of the ancient birch forest. Today, Atli teaches biology at Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð, after years of teaching physiology at the University of Iceland. While he hasn’t got decades of reforestation experience or an extensive background in birch research, Iceland’s biology and Iceland’s great outdoors have become something of a passion. “I’ve often lamented the state of the land surrounding the capital area, which is looking shabby after centuries of unsustainable land use,” he told Bændablaðið recently. “Most of the city’s inhabitants likely consider the rocky and mossy Mosfellsheiði heath, with its areas of exposed soil to be the natural state of the local vegetation. I believe we owe it to ourselves to try to regain a part of the earlier quality of the land and restore its biodiversity. As official parties haven’t done enough in this area, I decided to try and start my own mission in hopes that despite its small reach, it will inspire others to follow suit.” Following environmental protection, formerly deforested areas have been known to regain their former vegetation. In a conversation with Iceland Review, Atli mentions Þórsmörk, an area that in the 19th century, had become all but bare of trees, and was facing soil erosion. Protected from tree felling and fenced off from grazing sheep in the 1920s, the area is now once more verdant and covered in the shrubs and the low birch trees emblematic of the local birch forests. Another example of a protected birch forest is Hafnarskógur, the birch forest at the root of Hafnarfjall, just across the fjord from Borgarnes, about an hour’s drive north of Reykjavík. This is believed to be one of the rare patches of Iceland that have been covered in birch forest since before the country’s settlement, and probably during the few thousand years since the last ice age. Scientists have found that the Hafnarskógur soil is one of the most carbon-rich soils in Iceland, which could mean that reclaiming birch forests could do its part to bind carbon in the long term. Atli’s mission aims to reclaim the Elliðakotsheiði birch forest (the southwest part of the Mosfellsheiði heath). The land he is working on is within the capital area’s sheep-free zone, so grazing sheep won’t affect his efforts, and landowners have graciously given him permission to partially reclaim the ancient vegetation. His aim is to only spread native Icelandic species, such as downy birch, tea-leaved willow, or woolly willow, in addition to grass seeds for the rocky areas with eroded soil. He started preparing the project in 2020 and the following spring, he got to work. “I’ve already distributed about ten shoeboxes of birch seeds, planted about 1,000 willow cuttings and 500 birch seedlings. My goal is to plant 1000 birch trees next year, but I’ll have fewer seeds as last year wasn’t a good seed-forming year for birch.” Atli plants the birch trees in clusters, so as they grow, these trees will have started to form their own seeds within the decade and take over from Atli’s manual work. This is what has happened during reforestation projects around the Hekla volcano, intended to stop erosion from volcanic ash in future eruptions. “According to what we know,” Atli tells me, “the birch forest is generally the natural final stage of natural succession in Iceland’s lowlands. By the end of the last ice age, Iceland was at a vegetational starting point and the result of thousands of years of isolated development was a country covered in birch forests.” That is – until humans arrived. Of course, there are no guarantees, as humans always affect their surroundings, both directly and indirectly, but it’s possible that if left alone for a few centuries, the birch forest would return on its own. “I’m helping things along a little quicker,” Atli says.        ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
152,Iceland Review,Support for PM’s Left-Greens Hits Near-Decade Low,2022/06/03,"According to a new Gallup poll, support for the government continues to decline. Countrywide support for the Prime Minister’s Left-Greens hasn’t been lower since the lead up to the 2013 Parliamentary elections. A new Gallup poll (“Pulse of the Nation”) indicates that Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s Left-Green Movement has lost more than a third of its support since the last Parliamentary elections. The poll was conducted between May 2 and May 31. The Left-Greens saw the most significant decline since the previous poll was conducted; the party has recently been criticised over plans to deport an inordinate number of asylum seekers. Only 8.1% of respondents stated that they would vote for the Left-Green Movement if elections were held now, which is two percentage points lower when compared to the last poll – and 4.5% less than the Left-Green Movement received during the previous elections. Support for the party hasn’t been lower in nine years, RÚV reports. Support for the People’s Party has also declined compared to the previous Parliamentary elections (although the numbers have remained nearly unchanged since the last poll); 6.4% of respondents said that they would vote for the People’s Party, compared to 8% in the last poll. The party made headlines after screenshots of obscene text messages from MP Tómas A. Tómasson made the rounds on the internet. Chairman Inga Sæland subsequently stated that the party would “stand by” Tómas and that the controversy would not affect his role as MP. The Independence Party remains the most popular political party nationwide, according to the poll, with just over 20% of respondents declaring support. These numbers suggest decreased support from the last Parliamentary elections, however, where the Independence Party received 24.4% of the vote. Fresh off of successful municipal elections, the Progressive Party continues to enjoy increased backing since the last Gallup poll. The party stands out among the governing coalition as it appears not to have lost support from the previous elections (17.5%). The three governing parties are now polling at roughly 44%, which is about three percentage points lower than last month. The three largest opposition parties have all gained support from the last Parliamentary elections: the Pirate Party is polling at 14.7%, the Social Democratic Alliance at 14.1%, and the Reform Party at 9.5%. The Socialist Party is polling at 5% and the Centre Party at 4.3%.

The value has never risen more in a single year, RÚV reports. The latest property valuation figures were released by Registers Iceland yesterday and will mean higher property fees for owners. Some municipal leaders across the country have stated they will respond by lowering fees. The Registers Iceland website crashed for a period of time yesterday after the latest real estate valuation was released, as many wanted to check how much the value of their property had risen. Rates vary across the country, with the highest rise in Fljótsdalshreppur district (38.9%) and the smallest in Dalvíkurbyggð municipality (6.2%). Property valuation in the Reykjavík capital area rose just over 20%. Municipal authorities in Kópavogur and Hafnarfjörður have stated they will lower property fees in response to the steep rise. No such decision has been announced for the City of Reykjavík, where municipal councillors are still negotiating to form a governing majority following last month’s elections. According to Registers Iceland, the purpose property valuation is to provide grounds for the levying of public dues.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
154,Iceland Review,Fishing Industry Profits Spark Wealth Distribution Debate,2022/05/31,"Iceland’s largest seafood companies made huge profits last year, if the first published financial statements are any indication, Fréttablaðið reports. Opposition MPs are arguing that the industry should be taxed more so its earnings are more evenly distributed throughout Icelandic society. According to Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the nation sees the industry as unjust, largely because consolidation of fishing quota has funnelled large profits into the hands of very few individuals. At the end of 2020, the seafood industry’s equity was evaluated at ISK 325 billion [$2.6 billion; €2.4 billion]. In the same year, the industry paid just under ISK 4.8 billion [$37.7 million; €35.2 million] in quota fees, while the state treasury faced record financial challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fishing industry has continued to grow despite the pandemic recession. Between 2020 and 2021, the total value of catch in Iceland increased around 9%, from ISK 148.3 billion [$1.2 billion; €1.1 billion] to ISK 162.2 billion [$1.3 billion; €1.2 billion], according to figures from Statistics Iceland. Prospects continue to be good, especially since the price of fish has risen dramatically in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just four companies hold around 60% of Iceland’s fishing quota: Samherji, Brim, KS, and Ísfélagið. Brim reported profits of ISK 11.3 billion [$88.8 million; €82.9 million] last year, and Síldarvinnslan’s profits are similar. In the first three months of this year, Síldarvinnslan has made profits of nearly ISK 4 billion [$31.4 million; €29.3 million]. Samherji, Kaupfélag Skagfirðinga (KS), and other fishing industry giants have not yet submitted financial statements from last year, but similarly high profits are expected. In a column published in Morgunblaðið yesterday, Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated that the nation viewed the consolidation of fishing quota in so few hands as deeply unjust, and that it felt that this collective resource was not distributed fairly. Opposition MP and Social-Democratic Alliance Chairman Logi Einarsson echoed these words. “We have watched a huge accumulation of wealth in very few hands, which has also led to a small number of individuals not only holding the majority of fishing quota, but due to this same wealth, accumulated assets in many parts of society, in unrelated sectors.” Logi named these sectors as the media, real estate, transport, grocery stores, energy, and even insurance and banking. “This creates a very unhealthy situation,” Logi continued. “And now that the entire public expects worsening livelihoods and various healthcare and welfare services are underfunded, quota holders should certainly pay more toward public expenditure, they are well capable of it, to say the least.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
155,Iceland Review,"Prejudice Just Below the Surface in Iceland, Says Prime Minister",2022/05/30,"Iceland’s Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir is putting together a task force that will propose ways to tackle hate speech in Icelandic society, RÚV reports. Katrín stated she was appalled by recent reports of bullying faced by LGBT+ youth in the country. The Prime Minister says that while Icelandic legislation concerning equality has advanced in recent years, societal views can take time to catch up. A group of LGBT+ youth in the Reykjavík capital area has reported facing harassment on a daily basis, in part due to the influence of TikTok trends that popularise barking at queer people. The persecution has led many of the teens to avoid leaving the house, while their parents fear the effects the harassment might have on their children. One of the group’s friends, who also faced such harassment, committed suicide last year. Asked whether she was surprised that such prejudice against queer youth was coming from other young people, Katrín responded: “I think it just shows us that prejudice is just below the surface, that’s just how it is.” Read More: Calls on Icelandic Authorities to Tackle Hate Speech The Prime Minister’s Office oversees equality affairs, such as legislation on equal status and equal rights regardless of gender and sexual orientation.

Katrín says that while legislation such as the Gender Autonomy Act passed in 2019, has helped improve the status of LGBT+ people in Iceland, more needs to be done. “That’s one of the projects of this group on hate speech.

156,Iceland Review,Minister of Justice: Not a Single Family to Be Deported to Greece,2022/05/27,"Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson has stated that among the inordinate number of asylum seekers set to be expelled from the country not a single family would be deported to Greece, Mbl.is reports. Immigration affairs were discussed in Parliament today. As reported by Icelandic media earlier this week, the Directorate of Immigration appeared set to deport nearly 300 asylum applicants from Iceland. This inordinate number owed to a halt to deportations during the height of the pandemic as well as applicants delaying their case evaluations by refusing to undergo testing for COVID-19. Many felt that deporting people who had put down roots in Iceland was cruel, among them lawyer Magnús M. Norðdahl, who explained to Fréttablaðið that herding these people together and deporting them now was “reprehensible and not in the spirit of a community based on goodness and love.” Magnús added that some of his clients who were set to be deported had been living in Iceland for a long time, had settled down, been promised jobs, made connections in Icelandic society, and even had children. Responding to such criticism in an interview with Mbl.is today, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson agreed that the waiting period for applicants seeking international protection was unacceptably long but that he himself had “endeavoured to make the process more efficient.” He also noted that this protracted waiting period owed to disease-prevention measures during the pandemic and asylum seekers refusing to undergo testing for COVID-19. Nevertheless, the Minister expressed whole-hearted disagreement with the notion that the government was operating a “harsh” immigration policy. “We probably have one of the most lenient policies among those countries to whom we compare ourselves,” Jón told Mbl.is. “As far as I know, no European countries have ceased sending asylum seekers back to Greece.” When asked if conditions in Greece were acceptable, Jón replied that it was “not his place to judge,” arguing that it would be illegal to send people there if conditions were unacceptable. Jón pointed out that the number of asylum seekers set to be deported after a lengthy stay in Iceland was actually closer to 200 – and not 300, as the media had reported – and that the government had never planned on deporting families. Iceland boasts especially “loose legislation” when it comes to families seeking asylum, Jón maintained; those families who have dwelt in the country for more than 10 months have the right to have their cases reevaluated. Despite Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, Minister of Social Affairs and the Labour Market, having told the media earlier this week that he had “expressed grave concern” at a recent cabinet meeting, Jón Gunnarsson declared that the cabinet was “united” when it came to immigration affairs in a session before Parliamentary today. When asked about this seeming contradiction, Jón Gunnarsson replied that when he said that the cabinet was “united” he meant that everyone agreed to meet legal requirements and honour international commitments as far as the interests of asylum seekers were concerned. Jón pointed out that during the cabinet’s period in power, hundreds, nearly a thousand, applications for asylum had been rejected. “There has never been any dispute regarding the protocols, regarding those laws, or those processes, that are in effect,” Jón stated. “We haven’t changed a thing.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
157,Iceland Review,Bishop Reprimands Reverend for Harsh Rebuke of Government,2022/05/27,"Bishop of Iceland Agnes M. Sigurðardóttir has formally reprimanded reverend Davíð Þór Jónsson for his criticism of the government on Facebook. Despite the admonishment, the reverend has continued to express strong disapproval of the government’s plan to deport nearly 300 asylum seekers. On Tuesday, May 24, Reverend Davíð Þór Jónsson of Laugarneskirkja in Reykjavík published a post on Facebook in which he criticised the government’s plans to deport an inordinate number of asylum seekers. Davíð Þór stated that the government had decided to “piss all over” the UN’s Conventions on the Rights of the Child and, in reference to the Left-Green Movement, observed that there was “a special place in hell” for individuals who sold their soul for power and advancement. The reverend’s words did not sit well with Bishop of Iceland Agnes M. Sigurðardóttir. A press release published on the church’s website on Wednesday noted that the Bishop had formally reprimand Davíð Þór as she considered the reverend’s statements “harsh and in poor taste;” the church’s code of conduct requires that priests be “objective in their rhetoric.” The press release further noted that the Bishop viewed the matter as being “resolved,” while iterating Agnes’ call for “humaneness and mercy” in matters concerning asylum seekers in Iceland. Despite these admonishments, Reverend Davíð Þór continued his criticism of the government on Wednesday, this time referencing the Book of Matthew: “Woe to you, Torah scholars and Pharisees, hypocrites! … You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of hell? Because of this, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute in town after town. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth …
Pharisee: these words judge themselves.” The reverend’s concluding words may be interpreted as a jab at Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Chairman of the Left-Green Movement – and the reverend’s former partner; earlier this week, Katrín Jakobsdóttir was asked to respond to reverend Davíð Þór’s criticism and observed that “his statements judge themselves.” The fate of the asylum seekers remains to be determined. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, MP Arndís Anna Kristínardóttir Gunnarsdóttir of the Pirate Party expressed disbelief that the government and ministers would follow through with its planned deportation of nearly 300 asylum seekers. Referring to a recent report by the Red Cross, Arndís Anna observed that what awaited the asylum seekers, in the event that they were deported to Greece, was “hopelessness, lack of rights, destitution, insecurity, deprivation, homelessness, prejudice, and discrimination.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
158,Iceland Review,Contradicting Statements from Cabinet on Deportation of Asylum Seekers,2022/05/24,"Icelandic authorities are set to deport around 300 asylum seekers, some of whom have been living in the country for a long time and put down roots. Many of the deportations were delayed due to the COVID pandemic, but Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson has opposed making exceptions that would allow any of the group to stay in Iceland due to extenuating circumstances. Minister of Social Affairs and Labour Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson has stated, however, that he is examining whether there are grounds for granting some of the individuals work permits that would allow them to stay in the country. In a radio interview this morning, the Minister of Justice opposed making exceptions for some groups of asylum seekers over others. “What are we going to do with the people who come tomorrow then? Should the rules then apply to them or should we let the old rules apply? Just change the rules for these people and not others?” Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated, saying that such changes were not as simple as many people believed. In March of this year, Jón triggered a special article of Icelandic law to assist Ukrainian refugees arriving in Iceland by granting them international protection on the basis of a group assessment. The reason that the group of potential deportees is so high essentially boils down to restrictions that were in place during the height of the global COVID pandemic, the Minister of Justice has stated. The individuals facing deportation are from a number of different countries, and Iceland plans to send most of them back to Greece. Reports from Amnesty International and statements from the Icelandic Red Cross and other human rights organisations in Iceland have condemned the living conditions faced by refugees in Greece, who often have difficult accessing housing and basic services, even in cases where they have been granted international protection. The Minister of Justice denied this was the case, stating that refugees who had received protection in Greece “have the same living conditions as Greek people do.” Minister of Social Affairs and Labour Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson was singing a different tune when he spoke to Vísir reporters following a cabinet meeting today, however. He stated that he was reviewing whether there was a basis to grant some of the individuals in the group work permits that would allow them to continue living in Iceland. Among the group are families with children who have been attending school in Iceland, and Guðmundur Ingi stated that the rights of those children were an important factor to consider. Refugee rights organisations Solaris, Refugees in Iceland, and No Borders Iceland have organised a protest against the deportations this Saturday, May 28 in Austurvöllur square.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
159,Iceland Review,Formal Negotiations for Reykjavík City Council Begin,2022/05/24,"The Progressive Party has begun formal negotiations with the Social-Democratic Alliance, the Pirate Party, and the Reform Party on forming a governing majority on the Reykjavík City Council, RÚV reports. Under the leadership of first-time councillor Einar Þorsteinsson, the Progressive Party went from zero seats on the council to four following the May 14 municipal elections. Both Einar and incumbent mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson have stated they are not insistent on becoming mayor in the upcoming term: negotiations will focus on the issues before responsibilities are divided up. Reykjavík’s four-party governing coalition of last term – consisting of the Social-Democratic Alliance, Reform Party, Pirate Party, and Left-Green Movement – lost two of its 12 seats in the election, and therefore its majority on the 23-seat Reykjavík City Council. The Social-Democratic Alliance and Reform Party both lost seats, the Left-Green Party held its single seat, while the Pirate Party increased its number of seats from two to three. As elsewhere in the country, the Progressive Party saw great success in Reykjavík, going from zero seats on the City Council to four. The Independence Party, while it received the largest proportion of the vote (nearly 25%), lost one seat, going from seven to six councillors. As is normally the case for municipal elections in Reykjavík, no party won enough seats to form a majority on its own. While many different party coalitions are technically possible, several have been ruled out by party councillors, who are not willing to work with just anyone. The Left-Green Movement’s only councillor Lif Magneudóttir has stated the party will not participate in majority negotiations at all. The Pirate Party has ruled out a coalition with the Independence Party on political grounds, while the Social-Democratic Alliance, the Reform Party, and the Pirate Party have decided to band together in the negotiation process, ruling out a coalition that would include the Independence Party. Socialist Party councillor Sanna Magdalena Mörtudóttir criticised the three-party grouping for negotiations, stating that the additional seats won by the Socialist Party and Pirate Party indicated voters were calling for a left-leaning city council, not a right-leaning one. The Socialist Party has refused to be in a majority government with the Reform Party, which it labels as a right-wing party. “We see that the Reform Party speaks in favour of privatisation, outsourcing, and these market solutions, as was clearly stated in their election campaign. We Socialists speak for socialists and social solutions and very much in like with the emphases that should be expressed by the Social Democrats.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
160,Iceland Review,Deportations to Greece Resume After Hiatus,2022/05/20,"Asylum seeker deportations from Iceland have resumed after a two-year hiatus, Fréttablaðið reports. According to attorney Magnús M. Norðdahl, the police is now focusing on asylum seekers that will deported to Greece. It’s a relatively large group, counting more than 20 people, but that number could rise. Due to COVID-related travel restrictions, few people have been deported over the past two years. Magnús told Fréttablaðið that the deportation of those who have been denied international protection in Iceland resumed at the beginning of last week. Fréttablaðið confirmed with police officials that Greece’s vaccination requirements for travellers had been lifted and that deportations would resume. “My clients have received phone calls in the past few days notifying them of the impending implementation of deportation plans,” Magnús stated. According to Magnús, some of his clients who are set to be deported have been living in Iceland for a long time and have settled down, been promised jobs, made connections in Icelandic society, and even had children. “Among the people in the group is a woman who is eight months pregnant,” Magnús said. He considers it inhumane to deport people to Greece. “Conditions for refugees are completely unacceptable and many of them live on the streets.” Most egregiously inhumane, according to Magnús are deportations in cases where people have been living in Iceland for a long time and put down roots. “The global pandemic limited the authorities’ ability to deport people, which increased the time they spent here. To gather these people and deport them now is reprehensible and not in the spirit of a community based on goodness and love.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

Iceland’s delegation is headed by President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja D. Alfreðsdóttir. Lilja told the national broadcaster there needs to be broad collaboration in order to ensure the digital future of Icelandic language. She extended praise to computer scientists and entrepreneurs for the progress Iceland has made. Representatives from Apple said few countries have come as far as Iceland in developing language technology. “Few issues are as important to me as Icelandic, it is the basis of everything we do and stand for,” said Lilja, who is working on four core projects of the Icelandic government’s language technology program. Among the innovations on the Icelandic delegation’s wish list is speech recognition that provides the ability to communicate verbally with devices. This is of particular importance for increasing the accessibility of those unable to type text. Speech synthesizers are also being developed that can read Icelandic text clearly, to sound natural and be more easily understood, as are translation programs, auto-correct tools and language databases.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

163,Iceland Review,Municipal Election Results: Gains for Progressives Across Iceland,2022/05/16,"Last Saturday’s municipal elections will go down in Icelandic history books, both for the Progressive Party’s success across the country, and the Independence Party’s worst-ever outcome in Reykjavík. The Progressive Party doubled its following nationwide compared to the last municipal election, held in 2018, and more than tripled its number of councillors from 22 to 67. Iceland holds municipal elections every four years, in all municipalities concurrently. While the results gave the Progressive Party much to celebrate, several other parties saw losses in their number of seats on local councils, including the Centre Party, the Social-Democratic Alliance, and the Reform Party. While the Independence Party lost following across the country, it remains the party with the most local councillors nationwide: 110. Reykjavík’s four-party governing coalition – consisting of the Social-Democratic Alliance, Reform Party, Pirate Party, and Left-Green Movement – lost two of its 12 seats in the election, and therefore has lost its majority on the 23-seat Reykjavík City Council. The Social-Democratic Alliance and Reform Party both lost seats, the Left-Green Party held its single seat, while the Pirate Party increased its number of seats from two to three. As elsewhere in the country, the Progressive Party saw great success in Reykjavík, going from zero seats on the City Council to four. The Socialist Party also saw an increase in voters, doubling their seats from one to two. While it received the largest proportion of the vote, or nearly 25%, the Independence Party lost one seat, going from seven to six councillors following the election. Voter turnout decreased in all of the country’s largest municipalities except Hafnarfjörður, where it increased by 2.4%. The lowest voter turnout was in Reykjanesbær, where less than half of registered voters turned up to the polls. Voter turnout was 63% across the country, a drop from 68% in the last municipal elections. In Reykjavík, voter turnout was 61.1%, or 5.9% lower than in 2018. It bears noting, however, that amendments to election legislation that took effect in January increased the number of registered voters in the city by around 10,000. A total of 61,359 people voted in the city in this year’s election, while in 2018 that number was 60,417. In light of the weekend results, parties across the country are beginning coalition talks. In Reykjavík, Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson has announced that his Social-Democratic Alliance has begun negotiations with the Pirate Party and the Reform Party on forming a governing coalition. Progressive Party councillor Einar Þorsteinsson said he was open to collaborating with all parties with seats on the council. Independence Party councillor Hildur Björnsdóttir stated she had had several informal talks with other councillors, while Left-Green Movement councillor Lif Magneudóttir has stated the party will not participate in majority coalition talks this term.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
164,Iceland Review,Seaman’s Association: Government’s Stalled Negotiations with Coast Guard Pilots “Unacceptable and Disgraceful”,2022/05/14,"The Icelandic Seaman’s Association has issued a strongly worded statement in support of Iceland’s Coast Guard pilots, calling the government’s delay in negotiations “unacceptable and disgraceful,” Mbl.is reports. The Coast Guard pilots have been without a contract since December 31, 2019. ‘A hopeless position’ As Iceland’s Coast Guard pilots have police powers, they are legally prohibited from going on strike, which puts them in “a hopeless position” when it comes to contract bargaining, says Sonja Bjarnadóttir Backman, a lawyer with the Icelandic Airline Pilots’ Association (FÍA). Per a statement issued by FÍA in April, Coast Guard pilots’ “labour agreements have historically been linked to CLAs of comparable professions, for the longest time through a statutory link, or until 2006.” That arrangement is now under “vigorou[s] attack” by the Ministry of Finance, however, which FÍA says is pushing “a clear demand for a new, original wage agreement without links to comparable professions. This will not only affect pilot benefits but will also greatly increase staff turnover among the Coast Guard’s pilots.” With “hundreds of millions of ISK” spent on training each pilot, high turnover amongst the Coast Guard’s pilots is clearly costly to the state monetarily, but also has the associated cost of lost experience and knowledge among the highly trained professionals who oversee rescue operations at sea. “Increased staff turnover is therefore quick to more than offset the disconnection of wages from comparable professions,” continues the FÍA statement. The FÍA also takes issue with the Ministry of Finance’s desire to abolish the pilot’s seniority list, which it says is “one of the cornerstones of safety culture in aviation around the world.” “This arrangement has proved successful, as such lists ensure transparency, professionalism, and that pilots can report incidents without fear of punishment. The Ministry has presented no objective arguments to support its position, and in fact the pilots’ negotiation committee has perceived a lack of professional knowledge and understanding of the unique position of the aviation industry in the negotiations.” (Read the FÍA’s full “Resolution from the Pilots of the Icelandic Coast Guard here, in English.) See Also: Coast Guard Helicopter Unmanned Due to Pilot Shortage “It’s happened that there’s no helicopter available when needed,” continues to the statement issued by the Seaman’s Association. Indeed, due to staff illness, there was no helicopter available when a serious traffic accident occurred in South Iceland this week. Since it was not possible to man the helicopter crew, the injured person had to be transported by ambulance – making the trip one and a half hours longer than it would have been by helicopter. According to Ásgeir Erlendsson, communications officer of the Icelandic Coast Guard, for two thirds of the year, the Coast Guard has two crews on call, but for one third of the year, there is just a single crew on duty. In the past, illness or other staffing challenges have been solved by calling in staff who were off duty. That was, however, not possible on the day of the accident in question. This staffing shortage was denounced by the Minister of Justice, who wants to increase the number of helicopter pilots. But despite the Seaman’s Association’s later claims, this incident was said to be unrelated to the pilots’ ongoing wage dispute. ‘Ambulances of the sea’ The Seaman’s Association statement, which was cosigned by the Association of Ship Captains, the Association of Engineers and Metalworkers, and the Grindavík Seaman and Engineer Association, also drew particular attention to the fact that with only one helicopter on duty, it is not possible to rescue distressed sailors who are more than 20 nautical miles from land. “If ships are outside the 20 nautical mile-mark,” reads the statement, “they have to sail to meet a helicopter with their injured or ill. Minutes matter in these cases—let alone hours.” The Seaman’s Association presses the government to ensure that there are always two helicopters, or “ambulances of the sea” available, and concluded by saying that having only one helicopter on duty could have grave consequences for Icelandic and foreign fishermen alike.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
165,Iceland Review,Coast Guard Helicopter Unmanned Due to Pilot Shortage,2022/05/11,"For one third of the year, the Icelandic Coast Guard has only one helicopter crew on duty, RÚV reports. Yesterday morning the helicopter could not be manned to respond to a serious accident due to staff illness. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson says the situation is unacceptable and wants to increase the number of helicopter pilots. A serious traffic accident occurred under the Eyjafjöll mountain range in South Iceland just after 11:00 AM yesterday morning. One person was in the car and they were transported to the National University Hospital in Reykjavík for treatment. Since it was not possible to man the helicopter crew, the injured person had to be transported by ambulance – making the trip one and a half hours longer than it would have been by helicopter. Ásgeir Erlendsson, communications officer of the Icelandic Coast Guard, says that for two thirds of the year, the Coast Guard has two crews on call, but for one third of the year, there is just a single crew on duty. In the past, illness or other staffing challenges have been solved by calling in staff who were off duty. That was, however, not possible yesterday. The situation that occurred yesterday morning is not acceptable, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson told reporters. “Such incidents should not occur and we will try to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again,” he stated. Jón pointed out that the government budget outlines an increase in funding to the Coast Guard so that the number of shifts can be increased from six to seven. The government updated the helicopter fleet last year and the number of crews was increased from five to six. “It is no secret that with more crews it would be possible to increase the response capacity even further,” Ásgeir stated. The Coast Guard’s pilots have been without a valid collective agreement for almost two and a half years. The pilots assert that complying with the Ministry of Finance’s requirements would impact aviation safety. The Ministry has denied those claims. The manning of the helicopter crew yesterday is unrelated to the wage dispute.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

In his speech, Zelenskyy underlined the centuries-old ties between the two countries and urged Iceland to continue supporting Ukraine in the ongoing conflict, saying that “the size of a country is of no importance when fighting for democracy.” Before Zelenskyy took the floor, President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson addressed the Ukrainian President in English, commending the Ukrainian nation’s strength. He added that Iceland and Ukraine share values and that Ukrainian refugees are welcome in Iceland, even adding a few sentences in Ukrainian. Zelenskyy, in turn, began his speech with a few words in Icelandic, saying “Hello, this is Volodymyr from Kyiv.” He emphasised the ancient ties between Iceland and Ukraine: Scandinavians settled the area that is now Ukraine as early as the 8th century. He thanked Iceland for taking part in sanctions against Russia and encouraged the country to continue to put pressure on Russia. The Ukrainian President stated that Icelanders’ expertise in energy could come to good use in rebuilding Ukraine after the war is over. 







 A few dozen Ukrainians and supporters of Ukraine were gathered outside the Parliament building while the event took place, brandishing Ukrainian flags. Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Iceland’s Prime Minister, took the floor following Zelenskyy’s address. She condemned Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons, saying that military action should be resisted and assuring Zelenskyy that the Icelandic government would do everything in its power to help the Ukrainian people. She stated that Iceland wanted in particular to provide special protection for women and children who were survivors of sexual violence due to the conflict. The Prime Minister ended her address by asking those present to rise for a moment of silence on behalf of the Ukrainian nation.

The government approved the measures at a cabinet meeting this morning. They include raising social security benefits, income-related child benefits, and housing benefits. Almost half of households on the rental market receive housing benefits, according to estimates from the Housing and Construction Authority. Around 70% of them have index-linked leases. Housing benefits will be increased by 10% from June 1, and the income limit for receiving housing benefits will be raised by 3%. The cost of rent has doubled in Iceland over the past decade. Families receiving income-related child benefits will receive an additional ISK 20,000 per child [$153; €145], to be paid out by the end of June. The child benefit system is being reviewed “with the aim of addressing various shortcomings in the system,” in order to better achieve the objectives of reducing child poverty and supporting parents, especially in lower income brackets. From June 1, disability benefits and benefits for old-age pensioners will be increased by 3%. Inflation measured 7.2% in Iceland last month. The Central Bank instituted a sharp 1% hike in interest rates in response. Íslandsbanki analysts have predicted that inflation will continue to rise in Iceland, peaking in June at 7.7%.

169,Iceland Review,Advanced Polls Busy as Municipal Elections Approach,2022/05/05,"More residents have voted in advanced polls for the upcoming municipal election than in the last election, in 2018, Vísir reports. Amendments to election legislation that took effect this year require all parties to announce their candidacy before advanced polls open. The amendments have had varying effects on the May 14 election, including enabling more foreign residents to vote and making it more difficult to man polling stations. “So far today we’ve had 421 people vote here at the District Commissioner of Greater Reykjavík and since [advanced polls] opened, 2,800 have voted, and 4,063 across the whole country,” District Commissioner Sigríður Kristinsdóttir stated. There have already been more advanced voters in the capital area this election than in the entire country preceding the last election, in 2018. The advanced polling station for the capital area is open daily in the Holtagarðar shopping centre from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM. On election day, the station will be open between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM for voters whose registered address is outside the capital area. The new election legislation has made it difficult to staff electoral committees, particularly in smaller municipalities, RÚV reports. A new rule states that committee staff members may not appear as supporters on the election lists of campaigning parties. In many municipalities, this has ruled out a majority of election committee staff, who are scrambling to find replacements. The fact that the election falls on the same day as the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest final has reportedly also made staffing polling stations more difficult. Before this year, most foreign citizens living in Iceland had to wait five years before they could vote in municipal elections. The new legislation has shortened that period to three years, with Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish citizens whose legal residence is in Iceland can vote regardless of how long they have lived in the country. The amendment has led to some large shifts in voter demographics, for example in Mýrdalshreppur, South Iceland, where 42% of eligible voters are immigrants. The proportion is around one third in Skaftárhreppur and Súðavíkurhreppur, and around one quarter in Reykjanesbær, Southwest Iceland.

Since 2005, apartments owned by legal entities that own more than one apartment have nearly doubled, RÚV reports. The Icelandic Tenants’ Association held a public meeting at Kex Hostel yesterday. The aim of the meeting was to “demand answers” from candidates in the upcoming municipal elections on how they intended to ensure housing for tenants in Reykjavík. In an interview with RÚV, Guðmundur Hrafn Arngrímsson, a spokesperson for the Icelandic Tenants’ Association, stated that tenants had been made to suffer from the slow development of housing in the capital region through ever-increasing rent, greater uncertainty, and deteriorating social status. The Association maintains that legal entities and wealthy individuals have swept up real estate for the sake of profit and that investors have little or no incentive to speed up development as a slow pace ensures higher rent. In its coverage yesterday, RÚV presented a handful of facts to shed light on the state of the rental market. According to the Tenant’s Association, individuals above the age of 35 have “little chance” of escaping the rental market. 63% of young adults below the age of 24 live at home with their parents (39% of those who are under the age of 29).","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
171,Iceland Review,ISK 145 Million to Support Icelandic Education for Immigrants,2022/05/02,"The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour has announced its annual allocation of ISK 145.5 million [$1.1 million; €1.1 million] in support of Icelandic language education for immigrants. According to the ministry, the aim of the subsidy is to afford “everyone registered with a legal address in Iceland the opportunity to acquire the required proficiency in Icelandic to become active citizens in the country.” Foreign citizens account for around 15% of Iceland’s population. Eighteen schools, companies, and institutions will receive grants to conduct courses around the country. The subsidies are afforded to institutions that provide Icelandic language courses that are not part of a general curriculum in the public school system. The Icelandic government shuffled several dossiers when the current government took office last November, including Icelandic language education for immigrants, which was moved from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour. Unlike many of its Nordic neighbours, Iceland does not provide free Icelandic language classes for immigrants. Education available to the country’s newest residents largely falls into two categories: free conversational classes provided by community organisations such as the Red Cross, and paid courses offered by privately-operated schools. An eight-week paid course costs approximately ISK 50,000 [$375; €340], though union members can usually get 75% of this fee reimbursed. The University of Iceland also offers a diploma and a degree program in Icelandic as a second language. Hjalti Ómarsson of Retor fræðsla, one of the schools that have received funding through the grant, says public funding covers only about 35-40% of the school’s operating costs. “When it comes to public funding, there’s not enough. The amount of grant money available has not risen since 2009. And whether your company has 10 employees or 100, the amount you can apply for is the same. Workplaces complain to us that they exhaust their grant money very quickly.” The government did allocate increased funding to Icelandic language education for immigrants as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the measure was only temporary. No one at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour was available for comment. Read more about Icelandic language education for immigrants in our latest issue.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
172,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Plaza Renamed “Kyiv Square”,2022/04/27,"A small square in central Reykjavík will be renamed Kyiv Square in a show of support to Ukraine, the city’s authorities have announced. The square will also bear the name Kænugarður in Icelandic, an old Icelandic name for the Ukrainian capital. The square is located on the corner of Garðastræti and Túngata, amid a row of embassies, including Russia’s. “Reykjavík is sending a clear message of support for the Ukrainian nation here and at the same time referencing the ancient connection between Iceland and Kænugarður [Kyiv],” stated City Councillor Eyþór Arnalds. “The location at the corner of Garðastræti and Túngata is appropriate as those streets house the offices and embassies of foreign countries.” The notice from the City of Reykjavík states that Kænugarður “references the historic name of the city in Icelandic and emphasised its history that stretches back for millennia.” Scandinavians settled the area that is now Ukraine as early as the 8th century. The Kristni saga, written around the 13th century, refers to the city that is now Kyiv as Kænugarður. According to Vísindavefurinn, the first part of the word, kæna, is possibly derived from Kijane, the Old East Slavic name for residents of Kyiv, while garður shares the same root as the Old East Slavic word goród, meaning city. In modern Icelandic, Kænugarður also means “Kæna Garden,” an appropriate name for the square, which features greenery. The square will be known as Kyiv Square in English and will have similar names in other languages, in order to reference the city’s internationally-known name. The square is located amid a strip of embassies and foreign offices, including the Canadian Embassy to Iceland and the offices of the Faroese and Greenlandic delegations. The Russian embassy and Russian ambassador’s residence, where public protests have been held since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, are located a short distance up the street.

173,Iceland Review,Trust in Government Plummets Following Controversial Bank Sale,2022/04/27,"If an election were held today, the current governing coalition would lose 12 of their 38 seats, losing their current majority. The three governing parties: the Left-Green Movement, the Independence Party, and the Progressive Party, would win 26 seats in Alþingi – 32 are needed for a majority government. The data comes from a recent poll Prósent conducted for news outlet Fréttablaðið. Seven months since Iceland’s last parliamentary election and five months to the day since the cabinet was appointed, all three governing parties have lost significant following, according to the poll’s results. The Independence Party has experienced the biggest drop as compared to last autumn’s election results: from 24.4% to 17.9%. The Progressive Party now measures 12.4% support, as compared to 17.3% in the last election. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s party the Left-Green Movement has dropped from 12.9% support in the election to 9.6% in the poll. Among the opposition, both the Pirate Party and the Social-Democratic Alliance have gained significant following when the poll is compared to the election results, and the Reform Party has also seen a slight increase in support, putting them on par with the Left-Green Movement. The People’s Party and Centre Party have both lost following since last autumn. The Socialist Party, which did not win any seats in the last election, would win three if elections were held today. A recent poll from Maskína shows that trust in government ministers has fallen significantly since last year. The number of respondents that stated they trust Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson a lot has fallen by half since last autumn, from 37% to 18%. More than seven out of ten respondents stated they have little or very little trust in Bjarni.

It was the first time Alþingi had convened since before the Easter break and most of the discussion centred on the controversial sale. The government has received harsh criticism for the share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value, despite high demand for the shares. Many have also criticised the fact that smaller, short-term investments were permitted in the sale, and that staff of the consulting company that managed the sale were among the investors. The sale is being investigated by the Central Bank and reviewed by the National Audit Office. Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson presented an oral report on the sale during yesterday’s session. While maintaining that the sale had in general been successful, he admitted that it had raised questions regarding three aspects in particular: the possible participation of employees of the consulting company involved in the sale, the possible participation of buyers who did not fulfill the stated requirements of being professional investors, and the dissemination of information to the public. Bjarni stated that the public could have been better informed about the sale. He added that it had taked a long time to access and release information about the sale after the offering and some questions had remained unanswered for too long. Opposition MPs criticised the government’s decision to dismantle Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI) in light of how the sale went. They questioned whether that decision had truly been discussed at a cabinet meeting, as as an announcement from the government stated. Chairman of the Centre Party Sigmundur Davíð Gunlaugsson asked whether government ministers had any plan as to what would replace the ISFI. Íslandsbanki was fully owned by the government until last year, when it sold a 35% stake in the bank, something that had been on the government agenda for years. While that first offering was open to the public, last month’s offering was solely open to professional investors. The second sale reduced the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. Two protests have been held where attendees opposed how the sale was handled, calling for Bjarni Benediktsson’s resignation.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
175,Iceland Review,Many Icelandic Residents Unaware of Right to Vote,2022/04/26,"Foreign residents who have lived in Iceland consecutively for three years have the right to vote in municipal elections, but many of them are not aware of that right, says Sara Björg Sigurðardóttir, a candidate for the Social-Democratic Alliance in Iceland’s upcoming municipal elections. Citizens of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland whose legal residence is in Iceland also have the right to vote in municipal elections, regardless of how long they have lived in the country. “We’re talking about residents who have been living here for many years, paid taxes and fees, been active users of city services but didn’t know that they could vote in municipal elections,” Sara Björg told Fréttablaðið. “As a society, we need to do better when it comes to informing our residents about what rights they have in our society. One of the most precious ones is the right to vote.” Amendments to Iceland’s municipal election laws took effect on January 1 of this year, shortening the period foreign citizens must reside in Iceland before they acquire the right to vote in municipal elections. Municipal elections are held every four years in Iceland, and occur on the same date in all municipalities across the country. The upcoming municipal elections will be held on May 14, and advanced polls are already open.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
176,Iceland Review,Iceland Donates ISK 130 Million in Emergency Aid to Ukraine,2022/04/24,"The Icelandic government has decided to send ISK 130 million [just over $1 million; €929,000] in emergency financial assistance to Ukraine via the World Bank. RÚV reports that Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir announced the additional funding after attending a meeting last week in Washington, D.C. wherein international leaders met to attend the World Bank’s roundtable on Ukraine. The meeting was scheduled to coincide with the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This is Iceland’s second major emergency aid donation to Ukraine. In February, Iceland committed €1 million to humanitarian support in Ukraine, and also made a €200,000 contribution to NATO’s Trust Fund for the Ukraine Professional Development Programme. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Smyhal and Minister of Finance Sergei Marchenko were both present at the meeting and emphasized Ukraine’s urgent need for financial assistance, both in order to maintain basic services and also for reconstruction efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an address remotely. In her own address, Þórdís Kolbrún expressed Iceland’s desire to contribute as much as possible to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia’s invasion of their country. “The Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives and freedom,” she said, reemphasizing that Iceland continues to stand in solidarity with Ukraine.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
177,Iceland Review,‘Out with Bjarni’: Íslandsbanki Protesters Continue Calls for Minister of Finance’s Resignation,2022/04/23,"Protesters gathered in Austurvöllur Square in front of parliament once more on Saturday to voice their anger at the government’s recent sale of shares in Íslandsbanki bank. Hundreds of protesters gathered last week; the exact attendance numbers of Saturday’s event were not available at time of writing. However, Vísir reports that 2,000 people marked themselves as attending on the protest on Facebook, an event entitled “Bjarna Burt, Spillinguna Burt,” or “Out with Bjarni [Benediktsson, Minister of Finance], Out with Corruption.” The protest was a festive one, and kicked off with a performance by Páll Óskar, and included speeches by former and current MPs, a reading by the “poet of the protest,” Anton Helgi Jónsson, and performances by hip hop acts XXX Rottweiler and Blaffi. Hot chocolate and doughnuts were served before and after the rally itself.

The second sale was successful, reducing the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. The government has been criticised for the latter share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value. The majority of the investors who purchased shares sold their stakes almost immediately for considerable profit. Days after the first protest at Austurvöllur, the Icelandic government announced that it would be introducing a parliamentary bill to abolish Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI), the government’s holding company on the financial market. But protesters are not yet satisfied. See Also: Government to Dismantle State Investment Company The protesters have three demands: that the sale be rescinded, that Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson resign, and that the board and CEO of the ISFI step down. Now that the latter demand has been achieved with the dismantling of ISFI all together, protesters remain focused on their first two goals. ‘Out with the puppets of capitalism in the government’ “We’re going to learn from this,” said headlining speaker Davíð Þór Jónsson, a pastor and actor who has been an outspoken leader in the Íslandsbanki protests. “We’ll learn to never, never, never again trust these people with a single thing. We’ll learn to never, never, never again trust political parties that form a government that would allow this to happen.” His remarks were met with cheers from the crowd. “Our demands are unambiguous and reasonable,” Davíð Þór continued. “Out with the psychopaths [amoral people] in our financial system! Out with the puppets of capitalism in the government! Out with an ineffectual, cowardly Alþingi that doesn’t have the guts to affirm its lack of confidence in an unfit government that doesn’t just permit, but rather gives its blessing to the psychopaths plundering their own country!”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
178,Iceland Review,"Iceland Would Support Finland Joining NATO, Prime Minister Says",2022/04/20,"Iceland’s Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has stated that the country would support Finland and Sweden if they decide to join NATO, RÚV reports. Support for Finland joining NATO has more than doubled among the general public since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Katrín stated that Iceland’s Security Council is updating its risk assessment for Iceland. Katrín stated that the re-evaluation is “Based on both the events in Ukraine and what could possibly follow: that is, the possible accession of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. So this work is ongoing.” Katrín travelled to Finland earlier this month, where she met with Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin (pictured above). The two leaders discussed “Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, the European security situation and deepening Nordic cooperation,” according to a tweet from the Finnish government. When asked about Russia’s potential reaction to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, Katrín stated: “We see that they do not take this well in public discussion.

179,Iceland Review,Calls on Icelandic Authorities to Tackle Hate Speech,2022/04/19,"If hate speech has no consequences for the individuals who spout it in Iceland, that could serve as a certain recognition that it is acceptable, according to Doctor of Anthropology and Assistant Professor of Police Science Eyrún Eyþórsdóttir. Eyrún told RÚV it is up to Icelandic authorities to take concrete measures against hate speech. Icelandic media outlet Kjarninn withdrew an interview with deputy MP Lenya Rún Taha Karim from online circulation yesterday after the article received a flood of personal attacks against Lenya, including racism and hate speech, on social media. In the interview, Lenya Rún describes the disrespect and racism she has had to endure in Iceland as a person of foreign origin in the public sphere. “The fact that people appear under their own name [on social media] and express themselves in this way, that can perhaps be traced to the fact that there have in fact been few consequences for people in Iceland who have [used hate speech],” Eyrún explains. “Perhaps a precedent has even been set for hate speech, and if it is left undisturbed, then it creates a certain recognition that it is maybe just OK.” “Nothing has been heard from the authorities, they haven’t condemned this type of hatred that is put forth against certain members of society, and that’s a shame,” Eyrún observes. “In many countries, authorities have laid down plans, invested money, created hate crime units within the police and other such things, as a strong emphasis is placed on tackling [hate speech].” Eyrún previously headed such a unit within the Capital Area Police Department, but it has since been dismantled. The authorities themselves have been embroiled in a controversy regarding a racist remark made by Minister of Infrastructure Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson at a conference last month. Sigurður Ingi has been accused of violating the Parliamentary Code of Ethics by making the comment. Besides publishing an apology on his Facebook page, the minister has refused to discuss the incident. “Hate speech is of the nature that the more well-known and powerful the people that use it are, the worse its effect is in society,” Eyrún says. It can cause others to take up such language, “because they think that if the nation’s officials can allow themselves to talk this way then it’s OK.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

The decision is made in response to widespread criticism of how the government handled the sale of 22.5% of Íslandsbanki bank last month. No further sale of the state’s shares in Íslandsbanki will take place until a new system is in place, a notice from the government states. The sale of 22.5% of formerly state-owned bank Íslandsbanki last month through a private stock offering has been harshly criticised by opposition MPs as well as the general public.

The government has been criticised for the latter share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value. Notably, six foreign investment funds that were invited to take part in the offering sold all of their purchased shares in the bank within three days of listing, at a significant profit. These funds also participated in last year’s public share offering, meaning they have turned quick profits on the sale of the bank’s shares for a second time. Those funds include Silver Point Capital, Fiera Capital, Lansdowne Partners, and Key Square Partners. According to the shareholder lists Kjarninn has in its possession, most of the “smaller” investors that took part in last month’s share offering have already sold their shares in the Íslandsbanki. In total, 59 investors were permitted to buy shares for under ISK 30 million and another 79 for under ISK 50 million. Among the purchasers who are no longer listed as shareholders of Íslandsbanki are employees and owners of the consulting company that was hired to manage the stock offering. Some larger investors who took part in the offering, who bought shares worth several hundred million ISK, have also sold their stake in the bank. This includes Steinn Holding Company, owned by Samherji seafood company CEO Þorsteinn Már Baldvinsson and his ex-wife. One particularly controversial buyer in the offering was the company Hafsilfur, owned by Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson. The Finance Minister is responsible for the sale of Íslandsbanki, according to law. Hafsilfur is still listed as a shareholder in Íslandsbanki, and its shares have increased in value by around ISK 5 million since the share offering. Pension funds and other institutional investors have bought up a large part of the shares that smaller investors have sold at profit since the share offering. It was previously reported that pension funds requested to were allotted fewer shares in the offering than they had requested.

However, what specific matters about the sale are under investigation is not clear. “In light of the Central Bank of Iceland’s supervisory role, the Bank cannot comment on issues that are directly related to the state’s sale of a holding in Íslandsbanki,” a Central Bank spokesperson told Stundin. “The reason is that individual factors related to the sale may be examined by the Central Bank’s Financial Supervisory Authority, and an examination of certain aspects related to the sale has already begun.” As previously reported, Íslandsbanki was entirely state-owned until the government sold a 35% stake in 2021. While last year’s sale was a public offering, the March 2022 sale was only open to professional investors, who received an invitation to buy shares, which were then sold for 5% less than market value after markets had closed for the day. The blowback to the sale was swift once it came to light that, in addition to pension funds, those who purchased shares in March included Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson, the largest shareholder in Glitnir bank before it went bust in Iceland’s 2008 economic collapse; Samherji CEO and former Glitnir chairman Þorseinn Már Baldvinsson; and Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson. Stundin raised concerns last week about the status of those invited to the recent sale. The offering was meant to be open exclusively to institutional investors, but, Stundin’s source alleged, some investors who walked away with Íslandsbanki shares were general investors with third party securities firms. Also voicing concerns over how the recent sale was handled is Minister of Tourism, Trade and Culture Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, Vísir reports. She said Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson must be held responsible. What isn’t clear is whether Lilja is speaking for herself or if her sentiments about the sale and Bjarni are representative of the Progressive Party, of which she is vice-chairperson. Lilja sits on the Council of Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Restructuring of the Financial System along with Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and the Finance Minister.

Vigdís hopes the meeting will allow her to “set the matter aside,” RÚV reports. Words spoken in a “fit of frustration” As reported by Iceland Review earlier this week, Minister of Infrastructure and Chairman of the Progressive Party Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson attended the annual conference of the Icelandic Farmers’ Association last week.  After a night of “much singing, joy, and entertainment,” a few employees of the Farmers’ Association approached the Minister, asking him to partake in a photo-op. The photo-op involved lifting CEO Vigdís Häsler onto a makeshift plank. Finding the act inappropriate, the Minister refused to participate and uttered a racist remark about the CEO. (Vigdís is Icelandic but was originally adopted from Indonesia.) Vigdís published a Facebook post on the incident on Monday, saying that she had “never imagined she would have to write such a statement: I’ve never let the colour of my skin, my race, sex, or anything else define me.” Vigdís wrote that the Minister had uttered an “extremely hurtful remark,” without getting into the details. Shortly after Vigdís’ post, Sigurður Ingi published a written apology on Facebook. In an interview with RÚV on Tuesday, the Minister again apologised for his remark, adding that it had been spoken in a “fit of frustration.” According to Sigurður, he had tried to reach out to Vigdís on the morning after the annual conference and through the Association’s Chair on the following weekend. While pressed several times to clarify what exactly he had said, the Minister refused to repeat his remark. Hopes to “set the matter aside” As reported by RÚV last night, Sigurður Ingi will meet with Vigdís Häsler today. Vigdís hopes that she will be able to “set the matter aside” after the meeting, although closure will depend entirely on Sigurður Ingi.  In a brief interview, Vigdís stated that she had received “numerous messages over the past few days,” from the parents of adopted children, among others, in which it became clear to her that “all types of racism are widely tolerated.” She did not comment further on the meeting.  The Minister has received harsh criticism from the public, many of whom have called on him to resign. Opposition MPs have also criticised Sigurður Ingi. In a session in Parliament, Pirate Party MP Halldóra Mogensen stated that the Minister’s remark could be considered “a breach of law.” In response to the opposition, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated that Sigurður Ingi’s apology indicated that the remark had been unacceptable and should not have been uttered. “I don’t dispute the words of the CEO of the Icelandic Farmers’ Association in this matter, but we must also be able to accept it when people apologise,” Katrín stated.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

As Stundin reports, 209 investors participated in the March sale, with a handful of pension funds scooping up a sizeable number of shares. The largest single buyer was Gildi Pension Fund, followed by the Pension Fund for Icelandic State Employees, Brú Pension Fund and the Pension Fund of Commerce. All other investors purchased less than 4% each of the total shares available in this offering. Notable investors include Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson, the largest shareholder in Glitnir bank before it went bust in Iceland’s 2008 economic collapse; Samherji CEO and former Glitnir chairman Þorseinn Már Baldvinsson; and Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson. The full list of investors who participated in this round of sales has been published by Stundin. The investment in Íslandsbanki is paying off for those invited to invest. Share prices are up 11% since the sale. Stundin calculated that the Finance Minister’s father has already made ISK 6 million profit on his newly acquired shares, while the fishing company Jakob Valgeir ehf. has made ISK 102 million.

Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson stated yesterday that the information on who the buyers were would be published, if permitted by law. In an interview this morning, Chairman of ISFI’s board Lárus Blöndal stated that ISFI does not consider itself able to publish the data, as it is likely the buyers’ identity falls under bank secrecy regulations. He added that it is virtually unheard of for buyers to be publicly identified when such offerings are conducted abroad. A total of 209 parties bought shares in the March offering. The Finance Minister has previously stated that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers. Lárus stated that all of the buyers could be legally classified as professional investors. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has argued that when state property is sold, the Icelandic public is entitled to know who the buyers are. During Alþingi’s question period on Monday, she stated that “If any technical factors cause ISFI to consider ifself unable to publish that information, I believe it is right for Alþingi to make appropriate changes to the legal framework so that it can be published, anything else is unacceptable.” Read more about the sale of state-owned banks in Iceland.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0

188,Iceland Review,Agreement on Long-Awaited New Research Vessel Signed,2022/04/01,"The Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) will receive a new research vessel in 2024. Yesterday, the institute’s director signed an agreement with government ministers and the Spanish contractor Astilleros Armón. In June 2018, on the centenary of Iceland’s sovereignty, Parliament approved a bill granting the Minister of Fisheries the authority to initiate preparations for the construction of a new research vessel for the Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI). The new vessel would replace Bjarni Sæmundsson HF-030, which was constructed in 1970. The MFRI would continue to use Árni Friðriksson, a much younger vessel, built in 2000. Yesterday, Þorsteinn Sigurðsson, the Director of the MFRI, signed an agreement with Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson; Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir; and an unnamed representative from the Spanish shipbuilding company Astilleros Armón for the construction of the new research vessel. “This is a milestone in the history of marine research in Iceland,” Þorsteinn stated in an interview with Mbl.is yesterday. According to the director, discussions regarding the construction of a new research vessel began around the turn of the century. At the time, a decision was made to refit Bjarni Sæmundsson, with the repairs expected to last until 2012. Yesterday, the MFRI signed an agreement for the long-awaited new vessel. Construction is expected to take 30 months. If all goes according to plan, the vessel will arrive in Iceland in the fall of 2024. As noted by Mbl.is, an emphasis will be placed on fuel efficiency and environmentally friendliness in the construction of the new vessel. It will be 70 metres long and 12 metres wide.

189,Iceland Review,"Housing Available for 1,815 Ukrainian Refugees",2022/03/30,"The Multicultural Information Centre (MCC) estimates that accommodation is currently available to house up to 1,815 refugees from Ukraine, Vísir reports. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, housing has been offered by the public, hotels and, notably, Bifröst University. MCC director Nichole Leigh Mosty said the centre has received 363 accommodation offers from 51 municipalities, with the vast majority in the capital area. In the first week after MCC invited people to register available accommodation, the centre received 100 offers per day, with many individuals offering available rooms in their homes. That figure has since slowed to less than 100 offers per week and trended toward full apartments. “The municipalities are working hard to map services and work with us,” Nichole told Vísir. “Now an interim solution is being launched where people get housing from three weeks to three months. As a result, more sustainable measures will be considered that better take into account the needs of each and every family.” An average of 18 Ukrainian nationals apply for international protection in Iceland daily, with 124 individuals arriving in the past week. A total of 508 Ukrainian citizens have applied for international protection in Iceland since Feb. 24, and a report from the National Commissioner of Police estimates another 496 individuals will apply for protection over the next four weeks.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
190,Iceland Review,"Iceland’s Economic Outlook “Improving,” Despite Rising Inflation",2022/03/29,"The annual inflation rate hit 6.7% this morning. It hasn’t been higher since May 2010. In a press conference today, introducing the government’s fiscal plan, Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson maintained that the economic outlook was “improving.” According to data published on the website of Statistics Iceland this morning, the annual inflation rate in Iceland has hit a near 12-year high: 6.7% – an increase of almost a percentage point (0.94%) since last month. The biggest driver for this recent increase has been a rise in the price of housing, gas, and clothing. The price of oil and gas rose by 8.2%, the cost of housing by 2%, and the price of clothing and footwear by 5.3%. As noted by RÚV, the inflation rate has seen a sharp increase over the past few months. The annual inflation rate was 4.3% in August of last year, and it has risen steadily since then. The first three months of this year have seen the steepest increase, or ca. half a percentage point from December. The inflation rate has exceeded the Central Bank’s target rates (2.5%) for almost two years, RÚV notes. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson introduced the government’s fiscal plan today. “We’re exiting a deep economic depression, in which we employed the state finances to safeguard households and companies … we’ve been protecting our public services and ensuring that we’re prepared to recover when the effects of the pandemic began to subside. I think we’ve been very successful in this regard,” Bjarni stated. A press release on the fiscal plan echoes the Finance Minister’s statement, stating that “the financial standing of households and companies is strong,” and that the government’s debt prospects have “improved considerably:” “The government is hopeful that a moderate increase in outlays and continued growth within expanding export industries” will provide “an opportunity to strengthen the (economic) base again and work towards building an even more robust society.” A few key figures from the press release on the new policy: As noted in the above-mentioned press release, the government will be emphasising several issues in its fiscal plan, among them mental health. The policy area will receive a permanent increase of ISK 500 million ($3.9 million / €3.5 million) in 2023, and an additional increase of ISK 100 million ($800,000 / €700,000) each year for the following two years. Other notable issues that the government will be emphasising in its policy are investments in research and innovation (ISK 25 billion); combatting the long-term social and health-related effects of the pandemic (ISK 3 billion); and defence and cyber security (ISK 2.2 billion). 2.6% of government spending will be allocated to environmental issues. There was no mention of a national stadium in the fiscal plan. The fiscal plan will be in effect for the years 2023-2027.   This article was updated at 12:48 PM.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
191,Iceland Review,"New Hospital Won’t Meet Bed-Demand, Report Finds",2022/03/28,"A new government report finds that the healthcare system will be significantly short of hospital beds by 2040, even with the new hospital opening on Hringbraut in Reykjavík. The Director of the new hospital hopes that the war in Ukraine won’t delay construction. On March 18, the Ministry of Health released a report on the future development of the National University Hospital of Iceland (Landspítali). The report, which was based on data from 2019, was predicated on analytical work done by the management consulting company McKinsey & Company. Among the report’s main findings was that the need for hospital beds in Iceland is expected to rise by 80% by 2040. This need is driven mainly by demographic changes, with the average age in the country expected to increase by 9% and the total population expected to increase by 18% over the next 18 years. Given these changes, the healthcare system would have only half of the needed hospital beds by 2040 if no significant actions were taken – even with the opening of the new hospital on Hringbraut (expected to open in 2026). According to the report, the healthcare system can tackle the shortage by shifting long-term and primary care from Landspítali to “a more (sic) adequate healthcare setting.” The health authorities would need to create the equivalent of ca. 240 bed capacity in home-based, elderly, and rehabilitation-care facilities. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, Runólfur Pálsson, Director of the National University Hospital of Iceland, responded to the report by saying that “time was of the essence.” “Everybody is familiar with the current facilities as far as hospital beds are concerned,” Páll observed. “Personnel shortage is also a growing concern. We should have acted sooner; the preparation time required for the construction of the new hospital was way too long.” As noted on RÚV yesterday, the current conditions at Landspítali er still difficult, even with a decline in COVID-19 cases. There is a significant shortage of hospital beds. Every day, almost 30 people must wait in the emergency ward to be admitted into the hospital. Furthermore, illnesses among staff, whether resulting from COVID-19 or influenza, have also made operations difficult. Many employees of the hospital have also gone on sick leave owing to work-related stress. In an interview on Friday, Gunnar Svavarsson, Director of the New University Hospital on Hringbraut, stated that the construction of the new hospital was, for the most part, on schedule. The Russian invasion of Ukraine may cause a delay, however, as the contractors can no longer import steel from Russia. “We hope there won’t be any delays,” Gunnar said. “As it stands, it’s looking pretty good. Some areas are behind schedule and others that are ahead of schedule.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
192,Iceland Review,"Iceland to Increase Defence Spending, PM Announces",2022/03/25,"PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir attended a NATO meeting in Brussels yesterday. Speaking to RÚV after the meeting, the PM stated that the government would be increasing its defence budget, with special emphasis on cyber security. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir attended an extraordinary NATO meeting in Brussels yesterday alongside Minister of Foreign Affairs Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir. The aim of the meeting was to discuss NATO’s short and long-term response to the war in Ukraine. “We condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms,” a statement released after the meeting by the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies read. “We call on President Putin to immediately stop this war and withdraw military forces from Ukraine, and call on Belarus to end its complicity, in line with the Aggression Against Ukraine Resolution adopted at the UN General Assembly of 2 March 2022.” In an interview with RÚV after the meeting, Katrín stated that although Iceland would not be participating directly in NATO operations, it would be offering humanitarian support. “We have decided to ramp up humanitarian support. That is, to increase our support even more. We’ve tripled our spending since the start of the invasion.” As noted on the government’s website, Iceland will be contributing an additional ISK 150 million ($1.1 million / € 1 million) to humanitarian aid. The authorities have already spent more than ISK 500 ($3.9 million / € 3.5 million) million since the war began. Given that NATO has decided to activate its defence plans, Katrín Jakobsdóttir also expects increased traffic above and around Iceland. NATO’s defence plans involve, among other things, the deployment of “significant air and naval assets.” “Defence plans have been activated for all NATO zones,” Katrín observed, “including areas to which Iceland and Norway belong. So we can expect increased air and sea traffic.” Iceland will also be increasing its NATO funding. “We will increase our spending over the next few years, and that spending will be focused on cyber security, which is also an area of emphasis within NATO,” Katrín told RÚV.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
193,Iceland Review,Icelandic Government to Stop Subsidising Rapid Testing for COVID-19,2022/03/24,"On April 1, Iceland’s government will stop subsidising rapid COVID-19 testing centres, a notice from the Health Ministry states. The regulation first came into force on September 16, and allowed private parties to offer rapid testing services free of charge. Symptomatic testing will continue to be conducted at primary healthcare centres and health care institutions, free of charge. Testing for travellers who require a COVID-19 test certificate will remain available for a fee. PCR exams at primary healthcare centres and healthcare institutions for those who require a travel certificate will cost ISK 7.000 [$54; €50], as before. The Icelandic government’s test and trace policy was key to curbing the spread of COVID-19 during the first waves of the pandemic. It came at a hefty price tag, however: RÚV reported that between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year, the government spent over ISK 9 billion [$70 million; €63.7 million] on COVID-19 testing. The largest portion of that cost is attributed to PCR testing, followed by border testing, and then rapid testing, which was not introduced in Iceland until mid-2021. Iceland lifted all domestic restrictions due to COVID-19 on February 25, 2022, including mandatory isolation and quarantine. While infection rates remain relatively high, hospitalisation and death rates are dramatically lower than in previous waves of the pandemic.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
194,Iceland Review,State Sells 22.5% Stake in Íslandsbanki,2022/03/24,"The Icelandic government sold a 22.5% stake in Íslandsbanki bank last Tuesday in an offering for professional investors. Opposition MPs have criticised the shares’ low price and the sale’s lack of transparency. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson says the aim was to acquire long-term investors and that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers. Íslandsbanki was fully owned by the Icelandic state until last year, when it sold a 35% stake in the bank, something that had been on the government agenda for years. While last year’s sale was a public offering, this week’s was only open to professional investors, who received an invitation to buy shares, which were then sold at a 5% discount from their market value. The sale was successful, reducing the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. According to information from Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI), demand for the shares was high. Both Icelandic and foreign investors showed interest in the sale, though the identity of the investors has not been made public. Investors were required to sign a confidentiality agreement, meaning they were temporarily granted access to inside information. Investors had already made a profit yesterday, when shares in the bank rose by ISK 4-5 billion [$31.1-38.9 million; €28.3-35.4 million] following the sale. MPs criticised the sale’s lack of transparency in Parliament yesterday, as well as the discount given to investors. Financial expert Ásgeir Brynjar Torfason told RÚV it is unclear how the investors were selected, and that is a question that ISFI and the Ministry of Finance need to answer. He also called on authorities to answer why such a large discount was given, despite high demand for the shares. In an interview with RÚV, Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson called the discount on the shares a small one, saying that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers in the offering. “We did not go the route of looking for the pension fund or the investor who wanted to offer the highest price and let them have as much as they wanted. We took another route. We wanted to go toward more decentralised ownership and we wanted to consider what the market conditions would be like when the offering ended. That there would be a [financially] healthy group behind the bank.”","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0

He added that while there has not been consensus on the bill within Parliament, he believes the working group will help solve existing disagreements. “I have put the matter into a very broad consultation, which is what is often called for, and then I intend to introduce it in the autumn session, which is only five months away,” the Health Minister stated.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
196,Iceland Review,Disappointment as Health Minister Shelves Decriminalisation Bill,2022/03/22,"Health Minister Willum Þór Þórsson has received criticism for shelving a bill that would have decriminalised possession of illegal drugs in small amounts. Kristín Davíðsdóttir, director of the Icelandic Red Cross’ harm reduction team, says the Minister’s decision to take the bill off Parliament’s calendar is a big disappointment that will negatively impact at-risk populations. “I have to admit that this somewhat surprised me, I didn’t expect it. It seemed to us that there was a certain momentum in the whole community in support of decriminalisation,” Kristín told RÚV. “We have seen a big change just in the nation’s opinion. Around 60% of the nation describes itself as supportive of decriminalisation today. So I found it sad, first and foremost.” Iceland legalised safe injection sites in 2020, but it wasn’t until earlier this month that the Red Cross opened the country’s first: a mobile site that is stationed in downtown Reykjavík between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM, while shelters are closed. The site provides clients 18 years of age and older with sterilised needles, helps them avoid overdosing, and even provides warm socks, hats, and gloves to those who need them. The regulations on safe injection sites permits clients to carry illegal substances in small doses. However, it complicates the site’s operation if those same clients can be arrested for possession at a certain distance from the safe injection vehicle, Kristín says. “And of course it’s just never good when things are set up in this way. And especially not concerning this group. This is a very broken-down group that has a hard time trusting, has a hard time trusting the system. I think it’s incredibly important to erase any kind of doubt just in order to foster increased safety and trust in this group.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
197,Iceland Review,Vote Recount Case Dismissed,2022/03/15,"The Police Commissioner of West Iceland has dismissed a case against the staff of the Northwest Constituency’s election supervision committee, Vísir reports. The staff have received letters informing them of the decision. The letters state that new legislation, which took effect on January 1, makes it unclear whether the staff had broken the law by not resealing ballot boxes between the initial count and a recount of votes. A vote recount in the Northwest Constituency following the Parliamentary election on September 25, 2021 redistributed five of Parliament’s 63 seats. As a result, several candidates filed charges against election proceedings in the constituency. Evidence showed that the election supervision committee had failed to seal the votes after it had completed its initial count and had left them unattended, actions that constituted breaches of regulation. Police had fined election staff, who had refused to pay the fines. A preparatory Credentials Committee was subsequently established (later succeeded by the actual Credentials Committee after parliament reconvened following a lengthy hiatus) to investigate these claims. Following weeks of discussions and a field trip to Hotel Borgarnes, the committee submitted its findings to Parliament last November. The Parliament then voted to confirm the election results in all constituencies, putting an end to the matter – except for the ongoing police investigation. West Iceland Police stated that the new election legislation that took effect this year is not sufficiently clear about the obligation to seal election data, though previous legislation had been. Therefore, the Police Commissioner considers there to be doubts about the criminality of the alleged violation.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
198,Iceland Review,Iceland to Open Embassy in Warsaw This Autumn,2022/03/15,"An Icelandic embassy to Poland will be opened in the country’s capital Warsaw this autumn, Iceland’s Foreign Minister announced at a cabinet meeting last week. The embassy will also be responsible for servicing Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belarus. Polish nationals account for around 40% of all immigrants living in Iceland. “Political, economic, and cultural relations between Iceland and Poland have increased significantly in recent years,” a government notice on the new embassy reads. “An ever-increasing number of Icelanders trace their origins to Poland. The countries’ interests converge on important issues, such as security and defence. Increased communication between the two countries, not least due to the large number of Poles living in Iceland, has strengthened trade and cultural ties.” The Polish government has operated a consulate in Iceland since 2008, which became a full-fledged embassy in 2013. “With the opening of the Icelandic Embassy in Warsaw, the necessary reciprocity in the political union of the states will finally be achieved, and it is gratifying to be able to take that step and emphasise how valuable the nations’ friendship is to us Icelanders,” Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir stated. “The Polish Embassy in Reykjavík has provided important services to the large group of Poles living in Iceland.

200,Iceland Review,Directorate of Immigration Broke the Law by Withholding Citizenship Applications,2022/03/10,"Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration (ÚTL) broke the law when it failed to hand over citizenship applications to Iceland’s Parliament last month, according to a legal opinion received by the Judicial Affairs and Education Committee, RÚV reports. MPs criticised the Minister of Justice for his handling of the issue in Alþingi yesterday. One MP urged the Speaker of Parliament to follow up on the issue and ensure the documents were delivered to Alþingi by the end of the week. Along with the standard process of applying for citizenship through the Directorate of Immigration, Icelandic law permits Alþingi to grant citizenship by decree, which it normally does twice a year. Unlike the standard process, the Alþingi route is open to applicants who do not meet the conditions for the granting of Icelandic citizenship. Applicants who take this route must submit detailed arguments as to why Alþingi should grant them an exemption from these requirements. Last December, Parliament could not process the applications submitted, as it never received the necessary application data from ÚTL. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson, who oversees ÚTL, defended the decision, stating that those who apply for citizenship via Alþingi should not get to “jump the line” ahead of others. MP Helga Vala Helgadóttir of the Social-Democratic Alliance stated that she was pleased that Alþingi’s legal office had taken a clear stance on Alþingi’s side in the issue. She added that this stance raised the question of how the Speaker of Alþingi would follow up on the matter, and asked whether the Parliament would receive the necessary documents before the end of the week. Helga Vala stated that she had heard ÚTL had rejected one of the applications in the group as the applicant had reached the age of 18 in the period of nearly one year that had passed since the application was submitted, without a ruling from ÚTL. As a result, the basis of the application was no longer valid in the case.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

Iceland’s Minister of Justice has triggered an article of law to facilitate the reception of Ukrainian refugees, but the decision will limit their rights, one MP argues. Pirate Party MP Þórhildur Sunna Ævarsdóttir criticised the government for its reception of Ukrainian refugees yesterday, particularly the Minister of Justice’s decision to trigger an article in Icelandic law providing temporary international protection in the event of mass exodus, which she argues gives refugees fewer rights than if the article had not been triggered. “The government has decided that they get a residence permit for humanitarian reasons which, as I say, provides inferior legal protection, does not include a work permit, and means that they will have to depend on financial aid from municipalities and will have to somehow find housing on their own once they’ve received this protection.

However, an even higher number of Ukrainian nationals arriving in Iceland recently could indicate that many are exercising their right to reside in the country for up to three months before officially applying for protection. Jón Pétur said border police could not rule out that scenario. He said authorities are considering increasing the preparedness level at the border to better handle the stress of arrivals from Ukraine on the immigration system. Iceland’s Social Affairs Minister Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson will appoint a special response team to coordinate the reception of refugees from Ukraine. “We are looking holistically at the reception system, from the time an individual arrives in the country until they receive services,” Jón Pétur said. “The reception system is resetting itself now that Article 44 of the Foreign Nationals Act is active.” Article 44 of the Foreign Nationals Act provides for the collective protection of foreign nationals in the event of mass exodus.

Iceland’s Social Affairs Minister Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson will appoint a special response team to coordinate the reception of refugees from Ukraine. Iceland’s Minister of Justice triggered Article 44 of the Foreign Nationals Act last week to provide immediate, though temporary, protection for Ukrainians fleeing as a result of the Russian invasion. One of the biggest challenges will be finding housing for the refugees, according to the chairman of Alþingi’s Refugee Committee, Stefán Vagn Stefánsson. “That’s one of the big projects, to find housing for the people, and the problem is that we don’t know how much will be needed. Finding housing has gone better than we assumed it would. Private parties have contacted us and offered housing. That’s incredibly important and helps a lot. It’s also a cause for celebration that the Icelandic Confederation of Labour’s central committee encouraged labour unions to join the effort last week.” Stefán also expressed his hope that municipal authorities would help in finding housing. While there are currently three municipalities in the country with active government contracts for the reception and resettlement of refugees, he says more will have to be added in order for the project to be successful.

204,Iceland Review,“Everyone Loses” in New Legal Assistance Scheme for Asylum Seekers,2022/03/07,"The Justice Ministry and Directorate of Immigration (ÚTL)’s new legal assistance scheme for applicants for international protection will lead to higher costs, longer processing times, and inferior service, a lawyer at the Icelandic Red Cross has stated. Last month, the Justice Ministry decided not to renew its contract with the Red Cross, which had provided legal assistance to asylum seekers for nearly seven years. According to Red Cross lawyer Guðríður Lára Þrastardóttir, the new scheme laid out by ÚTL is worse for asylum seekers, the government, and the lawyers providing the service. Vísir reported first. The Directorate of Immigration published an advertisement last week calling on applications from those who would provide legal assistance to applicants for international protection. In a post on Facebook, Guðríður stated that the scheme outlined in the advertisement is “really the same as scheme that was in place before the Icelandic Red Cross took over and was considered not good at all.” She adds that the hourly rate proposed for lawyers has only been raised by ISK 1,000 [$7.48; €6.88] since 2014, and is “still the lowest rate the state pays for lawyers’ services.” According to Guðríður, the proposed maximum hours in the scheme “do not in any way reflect the reality, and the Red Cross, which has done this work for nearly 7 years was not contacted when this aforementioned maximum time was calculated.” The scheme also does not appear to take into account the cost of interpreting services, Guðríður stated. “This is a sad turning point,” Guðríður wrote. “In my opinion, this scheme will lead to worse quality, much higher costs, worse service, and longer case processing times. Everyone loses here.” The changes are implemented as asylum seeker applications reach a seven-year high in Iceland.

205,Iceland Review,"Capelin Quota to Be Increased by 50,000 Tonnes",2022/03/04,"Icelandic fishing companies are likely to be granted an additional quota of ca. 50,000 tonnes’ worth of capelin, Vísir reports. The announcement comes as the most valuable phase of capelin season, the processing of roe, commences. As Norwegians vessels were unable to use the full extent of their capelin allowance in Iceland – when their season on Icelandic waters concluded – the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries is expected to reallocate the remainder of the quota among Icelandic vessels, Vísir reports. As reported by Mbl.is, the authorities rejected Norway’s request for an extension in February. This reallocation, which could comprise around 50,000 tonnes, could come into effect as early as today. If Icelandic vessels manage to fully utilise this additional quota, the value of the catch could be worth between two to three billion ISK (€14-21 million / $15-23 million). The announcement comes as the most valuable phase of the capelin season, the processing of roe, commences. Roe-processing is expected to be in full swing around the country, as companies race against time to catch as much capelin as possible before they spawn. As noted in Iceland Review last year, the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute of Iceland set its new advice for capelin catch quotas at 904,200 tonnes for the 2021/22 season. This quota is nearly sevenfold of last year’s quota and a dramatic shift from 2019 and 2020 when no capelin quota was issued at all.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
206,Iceland Review,Special Article Triggered to Assist Ukrainian Refugees,2022/03/04,"The Minister of Justice has decided to trigger article 44 of the Foreign Nationals Act in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, RÚV reports. The article, activated for the first time in history, concerns the collective protection of foreign nationals in the event of mass exodus. Yesterday, the national ministers of EU member states agreed to provide special protection for Ukrainians in mass flight following the Russian invasion. Icelandic Minister of the Interior Jón Gunnarsson attended the meeting in Brussels and subsequently spoke to a reporter from RÚV. “EU member states decided to trigger the (temporary protection directive), involving the collective protection of individuals that are party to a mass exodus. There was great solidarity among the European ministers,” Jón Gunnarsson stated. “I have, therefore, decided to trigger article 44 of the Foreign Nationals Act, which concerns collective protection in a mass flight situation. This will expedite our reception of refugees.” Although Ukraine is not part of the passport-free Schengen Area, Ukrainian nationals are “entitled to visa-free travel for up to 90 days.” The triggering of the directive aims to offer a long-term solution in the event that the 90-day limit is exhausted. As noted on the website of the European Commission, temporary protection is an “exceptional measure to provide immediate and temporary protection to displaced persons from non-EU countries and those unable to return to their country of origin.” The measure applies when the standard asylum system is at risk of not being able to cope with the demand stemming from a mass exodus. When asked if this meant that this would remove all uncertainty for Ukrainians fleeing the invasion – as they would receive immediate protection without the delays that often accompany the standard processing of applications – minister Jón Gunnarsson replied in the affirmative: “Yes, on the basis of this legislation, they’ll receive protection without going through the system. This is the first time that this article is triggered in Iceland. It’s a kind of historic moment. We have opened our borders to these people, and there are a few who have already arrived. This will simplify our work and make the process more efficient.” The minister’s decision will be introduced before Parliament today.   (The first two paragraphs of article 44 on the Foreign Nationals Act: “In a case of mass flight the Minister may decide to apply the provisions of this article. The Minister also decides when authorisation to provide collective protection under paras. 2 and 3 shall cease. A foreign national who is a member of a group which flees a specified region and arrives in Iceland, or is in Iceland when the provisions of the article are applied, may upon application for international protection be granted protection on the basis of a group assessment (collective protection). This entails that the foreign national will be granted a residence permit under art. 74. The permit cannot serve as basis for the issue of a
permanent residence permit.”)",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

With two and a half months until municipal elections – and just over a month until the nomination deadline – it looks as if a minimum of nine candidates will be vying for the mayoral seat in Reykjavík, RÚV reports. The Social Democratic Alliance and the Pirate Party have already introduced their list of candidates, with Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson leading the former party and councillor Dóra Björt Guðjónsdóttir chairing the latter. Two primary elections will be held in Reykjavík next week when the Left-Green Movement and the Reform Party will decide on their list of candidates. Three women will be vying for first place for the Left-Greens: meteorologist Elín Björk Jónasdóttir, councilwoman Líf Magneudóttir, and substitute city councillor Elín Oddný Sigurðardóttir. Þórdís Jóna Sigurðardóttir and Þórdís Lóa Þórhallsdóttir will hope to lead the Reform Party The Progressive Party will be holding a constituency congress in Reykjavík on March 10 to introduce its list of candidates. It is widely believed that former RÚV anchor and journalist Einar Þorsteinsson will be leading the party. Handballer Björgvin Páll Gústavsson has announced that he will not be seeking first place. Primary elections for the Independence Party in Reykjavík will be held on March 18 and 19. A new leader will be elected given that Eyþór Laxdal Arnalds has decided to step aside. Substitute councilwoman Ragnhildur Alda María Vilhjálmsdóttir will be running against councilwoman Hildur Björnsdóttir for chair. The Centre Party will hold primary elections on March 26, where members will vote on its top three candidates. Councilwoman Vigdís Hauksdóttir will once again be running for chair. The People’s Party has not announced when it will reveal its list of candidates. It will not hold primary elections, and councilwoman Kolbrún Baldursdóttir intends to hold onto first place. The same holds for the Socialist Party, where councilwoman Sanna Magdalena Mörtudóttir will lead the party. This means that women will be leading seven out of the nine parties running in the municipal elections. (Municipal elections will be held across the country on May 14, 2022. Both citizens of Iceland, as well as residents of Iceland who have lived in the country for five years or longer, can vote in municipal elections.)",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
208,Iceland Review,Iceland Prepares to Receive Refugees from Ukraine,2022/03/03,"Iceland will receive refugees from Ukraine, as other European countries are doing, stated the chairman of the Icelandic Parliament’s Refugee Committee. The Directorate of Immigration has removed Ukraine from its list of safe countries, making it possible for Ukrainians to apply for international protection in Iceland, and several dozens have already done so. Authorities have yet to determine how many refugees from the country will be accepted, but preparations to receive them are already underway. “We have begun the preparations for the project but strongly emphasise monitoring and observing how European countries will assist the tremendous number of people that are now seeking refuge,” Stefán Vagn Stefánsson, chairman of the Refugee Committee, told Vísir. “We will try to the best of our ability to be in step with what other European nations are doing. We have initiated dialogue with municipalities to try to find out how much housing is available in the country.” Stefán stated that a number of municipalities in Iceland had already declared that they would like to participate in the resettlement of refugees. He expects more municipalities to do so. “It’s very gratifying to see the solidarity and the willingness from municipalities to take part in the project.” The committee has not yet determined how many refugees will be taken in from Ukraine. “I won’t give you a number because it doesn’t exist. We don’t have one yet. It’s very bad to give a number then not be able to honour it. The situation is such that this is very unlike the projects we have had so far,” Stefán stated. “This is a European country and residents of Ukraine are free to come here and be here for 90 days. Ukraine has been taken off the Directorate of Immigration’s list of safe countries, so people can apply for international protection. That has already begun, some dozens have applied for it, so the project has begun in some respect.” The Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Friday.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
209,Iceland Review,Housing Shortage Won’t Prohibit Iceland Receiving Ukrainian Refugees,2022/03/01,"Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir said Monday that issues surrounding the Directorate of Immigration’s housing facilities will not deter or delay Iceland’s reception of refugees from Ukraine, and preparations are already underway, Vísir reports. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson told Vísir last week that “there is a real state of emergency at the Directorate of Immigration (ÚTL),” exacerbated by the unwillingness of asylum seekers in Iceland to undergo PCR testing required as a condition of their deportation from the country. He said the Directorate’s difficulties in carrying out deportations of some refugees is resulting in less housing and fewer facilities available to welcome other refugees that the government is willing to welcome During question period in Alþingi Monday, Social Democratic Alliance MP Helga Vala Helgadóttir called the Minister of Justice’s comments unacceptable and asked the Prime Minister if they were reflective of the government’s policy. Katrín replied that many people are in very vulnerable positions and it matters how those groups are talked about. Furthermore, she said the status of ÚTL’s housing will not hinder Iceland’s reception of Ukrainian refugees. Katrín noted that the Minister of Social Affairs had already met with the Refugee Committee and preparations had already begun to receive them. The Prime Minister reminded Alþingi that half a million Ukrainians have already fled the country since the Russian armed forces began their invasion on Feb. 24, and that figure could increase to four to five million. She said a large proportion of those who have fled will likely want to return to their home country when the situation allows, so both short- and long-term arrangements need to be considered. “I would like to note that it is not long since the situation deteriorated in Afghanistan and the Icelandic government initially decided to receive a certain number of people and then decided to receive a larger number of Afghan refugees because we felt it was important to take responsibility for the global community. In relative terms, we actually welcomed more people than other Nordic countries did on that occasion. So when we look at what has previously been done, we have not shied away from taking responsibility,” Katrín said.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

211,Iceland Review,"Protesters, Authorities Voice Support for Ukraine",2022/02/25,"Approximately 300 people gathered outside the Russian Embassy yesterday to protest Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Additional protests have been scheduled outside the embassy for Sunday. The Icelandic government strongly condemned Russia’s attack yesterday and iterated its support for Ukraine. Following news of the invasion of Ukraine yesterday, Russian journalist Andrei Menshenin organised a protest outside the Russian Embassy in Reykjavík. Approximately 300 people were in attendance. Speaking to Morgunblaðið before the rally, Andrei stated he knew he spoke for many Russians when he said he was “devastated” by news of the invasion. “I’ve been in contact with my colleagues worldwide today, and they have the same story to tell,” Andrei remarked. “Everyone is devastated by this course of events and very saddened. Many Russians have posted a black profile picture on social media today to try to express how they feel and to show that they do not at all support this attack by Putin.” Further protests of the invasion have been scheduled for Sunday. As noted on a Facebook-page for the event – organised by Inga Minelgaite, professor at the University of Iceland’s School of Business: “There is no excuse for war in 2022. Standing up for peace is (the) responsibility of (each and) every (one) of us. Let’s meet for a peaceful protest to express our support to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.” Protesters are encouraged to light candles and flashlights and display the colours of the Ukrainian flag in a show of solidarity. In a statement yesterday, the offices of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir called on Russia to cease its military action and declared that the invasion was “a serious violation of international law.” Minister of Foreign Affairs Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir iterated the government’s unwavering support for Ukraine: “Iceland will continue its support for Ukraine, by taking full part in international sanctions. Iceland will respond to humanitarian needs by providing EUR 1 million for humanitarian support in Ukraine. This is in addition to a EUR 200,000 contribution to NATO’s Trust Fund for (the) Ukraine Professional Development Programme.” As noted in the press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Russian Ambassador to emphasise Iceland’s position.

212,Iceland Review,Iceland Lifts All COVID-19 Restrictions,2022/02/25,"All COVID-19 social restrictions have been lifted as of midnight today. Individuals who test positive for the coronavirus will no longer be required to quarantine, and no disease prevention measures will be in place at the border. Nearly two years after imposing the first social restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Icelandic authorities have lifted all limitations on public gatherings. Rapid tests will replace PCR tests, and individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will no longer be required to quarantine. According to a statement by Minister of Health Willum Þór Þórsson on Wednesday, the decision to lift social restrictions was unanimous among ministers – and in line with the most recent memorandum of Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason. The memo noted that severe illness has not increased over the past few weeks – despite over 2,000 infections being recorded daily. Þórólfur believes that the best way to end the pandemic is widespread herd immunity against the virus (ca. 80% of the population is expected to have become infected by mid-March). Approximately 110,000 individuals have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Iceland. Antibody testing suggests, however, that an equal number of people have already been infected without testing positive. Sixty one individuals have died from COVID-19 in Iceland since the start of the pandemic. “We can truly rejoice at this turning-point, but I encourage people to be careful, to practice personal infection prevention measures, and not to interact with others if they notice symptoms,” the Minister of Health stated on Wednesday. Among those who will be celebrating the lifting of restrictions are bar owners, who may now resume normal operations for the first time since July. The nightlife in downtown Reykjavík is expected to be especially busy this weekend. The National University Hospital warns of an increased strain on its operations and encourages partygoers to exercise caution. As noted by meteorologist Haraldur Ólafsson in an interview with Vísir, today’s forecast is less than ideal. An orange weather alert will be in effect for the capital area between 11 AM and 5 PM. Wind speed is expected to reach up to 25 m/s with sleet and rain. The storm will have mostly subsided by the evening.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir stated Iceland would take “full part in international sanctions” on Russia. Iceland’s National Security Council will meet today to discuss the Russian attack on Ukraine, RÚV reports. The meeting was scheduled prior to the attack launched by Russia last night. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated that the most pessimistic predictions of events in Russia and Ukraine have come to pass. “The Icelandic government and I condemn this attack, of course. This is a serious breach of international law and truly looks as if the worst predictions in this matter have come to pass,” Katrín stated. Asked about Icelandic authorities’ response, she stated that Iceland would collaborate with its allies and NATO, of which it is a founding member. Þórdís Kolbrún was asked whether authorities would consider deporting Russia’s ambassador to Iceland. “We called him to a meeting here yesterday and reviewed our case. Now the priority is really to support what needs to be supported within NATO, monitor closely and review what is happening.  As for the Russian embassy here, it will remain to be seen,” Þórdís stated.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir met with the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) yesterday, who issued a statement on the matter. The Icelandic government considers Russia’s actions to be a breach of international law, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated in an interview with RÚV. “The Icelandic government’s stance is completely clear. We consider this to be a breach of international law,” the Prime Minister stated. “This concerns the border of an independent state and not only have the Russians recognised the independence of these two regions but moreover sent troops over the border which is, of course, a very serious situation.” Katrín added that she hoped the current situation would not lead to conflict, and that “all diplomatic paths would be pursued as far as possible.” The Prime Minister tweeted along similar lines yesterday, writing that “Escalation and armed conflict is not the solution to current challenges. The door for diplomacy must remain open.” Iceland’s President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson retweeted Katrín’s statement, adding: “A clear stance by the government of Iceland.

215,Iceland Review,"Iceland’s Proposed Legislation Contradicts Code of Ethics, Doctors Say",2022/02/21," Doctors in Iceland will be forced to choose between obeying the law or obeying their international code of ethics if the government passes its proposed amendments to the Immigration Act, the chairperson of the Icelandic Medical Association stated in an interview with RÚV. The proposed legislation would grant Icelandic police the authority to force physical examinations on asylum seekers. The legislation was introduced by Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson and has been criticised by human rights organisations in Iceland. “In this 19th article, as it is worded, the police are given very broad powers to force people to undergo various interventions: testing, physical examination, and more. And also to hand over medical records, which are sensitive, confidential information. This completely contradicts doctors’ code of ethics,” Steinunn Þórðardóttir, chair of the Icelandic Medical Association stated. “The World Medical Association’s Declaration of Geneva [the modern-day Hippocratic Oath] reads as follows: the health and well-being of my patient will be my first consideration. We wonder how these two things can go together and actually see it as a complete impossibility. If this becomes law, we are put in the position of having to choose between complying with national law or the international code of ethics for doctors,” Steinunn remarked. The Association’s formal comments on the proposed legislation strongly criticise the proposed changes. “If a foreigner that is set to be deported is forced to undergo such examination, it can be assumed the person is opposed to being deported. Individuals in this position tend to have complex issues, often due to post-traumatic stress, and are being deported back to situations where they consider their life and health to be at risk. By issuing the aforementioned certificate, a doctor would need to consider that such deportation from the country would be in the best interest of the person in question, according to the aforementioned code of ethics,” the comments read. The comments continue: “Respect for the patient and mutual trust are the basis of medical practice. An action such as [forcing physical examination] works against patients’ interests and human rights, and we consider it to be in conflict with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
216,Iceland Review,Consolidation and Control of Quota Permits Under Scrutiny,2022/02/18,"Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir has instructed the Directorate of Fisheries to increase its supervision of quota permits. The Minister has also proposed a bill to grant the Directorate of Fisheries greater authority. These measures aim to prevent the consolidation of quota permits and deter non-compliance with laws and regulations within the fishing industry. Ever since Blackport (Verbúðin) premiered on RÚV in late December, the TV series has inspired nostalgia for the ’80s while also training the spotlight on the Icelandic fishing industry. The series, whose season finale premiered last Sunday, revolves partly around the transferable quota system, which was introduced in 1984 and allocated Iceland’s fishing allowance among fishermen-cum-boat-owners. Last Wednesday, Blackport served as a segue into proposed amendments to the supervision of the quota system in a conversation between Minister of Food, Fisheries, and Agriculture, Svandís Svavarsdóttir, and journalist Sigmundur Ernir Rúnarsson on the news programme Fréttavaktin on Hringbraut. Svandís observed that Blackport was an “excellent” series that had inspired Icelandic society to reflect back upon that “dangerous cocktail of business and politics,” noting that the temptation of corruption remained a real possibility. Later in the conversation, Svandís discussed what she felt were necessary changes to the quota system – changes publicised in a press release on the government’s website yesterday. As noted in the press release, Svandís Svavarsdóttir has entrusted the Directorate of Fisheries to investigate the consolidation and control of quota permits by associated parties within the Icelandic fishing industry. In her instruction to the Directorate, the Minister emphasised that the institution conduct a systematic investigation of the control of quota permits by associated parties and that it inform the Ministry of its findings at regular intervals. The Minister’s instructions are founded on two reports: a task-force report on the increased supervision of fishery resources, on the one hand, and a report by the auditor general from 2018 on the Fisheries Management Act, on the other hand. (Article 13 of the Fisheries Management Act defines the allowable quota share of individual and associated parties.) The Minister has also proposed a bill to amend specific laws within fisheries management, which the cabinet has approved for discussion before Parliament. The aim of the new legislation, which will grant the Directorate of Fisheries greater authority, is more efficient supervision to deter non-compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the management of fishing quotas. As noted in a press release from the Ministry: “The government must possess a clear overview of the control and consolidation of quota permits by associated parties in the industry. The systematic management of the Directorate of Fisheries is essential in this regard, and supervision must be improved. Furthermore, changes to the legal definition of “associated parties” in applicable laws are needed so that it is clear when two parties are considered “associated.” With these instructions and this parliamentary bill, the first steps are taken to make the necessary amendments in the supervision of the fisheries management system. Efficient supervision on behalf of the government is one of the conditions for engendering trust among the public in the management of the collective natural resource,” Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir wrote. According to an article in Kjarninn published yesterday, the ten largest fishing companies in Iceland controlled 53% of the allocated quota in 2020; in November of last year, the aforementioned share had risen to 67%. Parallel to these developments, the profits of fishing companies have increased significantly, with less than 30% of profits being collected by the Icelandic government in the form of income tax, payroll tax, and fishing fees, while 70% of profits settled in the coffers of fishing companies.

NATO has rejected these demands on the grounds of the principle of self-determination.

218,Iceland Review,Arming Police With Tasers Under Consideration,2022/02/17,"Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson will meet with the National Federation of Icelandic Police (Landssamband lögreglumanna) and police commissioners to discuss the possibility of arming Icelandic police with tasers, RÚV reports. The Federation says tasers would not be useful in situations where the attacker is armed with a firearm. If tasers were introduced into the force, it would be according to strict regulations, the Minister stated. Two shootings occurred in Reykjavík this month, just days apart, sparking a conversation about whether Icelandic Police’s standard equipment of pepper spray and clubs is sufficient. Research shows that police officers, the government, and the general public are all of the opinion that firearms are not necessary for police. Still, the number of police cases involving weapons (both knifes and guns) has increased in recent years, leading the force to reconsider what should be included in standard equipment. The National Federation of Icelandic Police stated in a press release that the discussion surrounding tasers is not directly linked to the two shootings, and that tasers would not be used in situations where attackers are armed with firearms. “However, such equipment must be investigated thoroughly to ensure police officers’ safety, but it should be borne in mind that such equipment will not be used when firearms are used,” the press release reads.

Including in neighbouring countries.” The Minister stated that tasers would help police officers avoid conflicts involving clubs, which are more likely to cause physical injury in arrests, according to some studies. The call to consider the use of tasers has come from the ranks of police, according to Jón. “I hear that and I am listening. I’m going to meet with them and afterwards, we will decide whether we take that step. And then we will do that according to very strict regulations.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
219,Iceland Review,Legal Services for Asylum Seekers Up in the Air,2022/02/16,"All 15 lawyers working for the Icelandic Red Cross were laid off after the Justice Ministry decided not to renew its contract with the organisation ensuring legal assistance to asylum seekers, Vísir reports. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson has stated that many changes to services for foreigners in Iceland are in the works. No decision has been made on how such services will be provided after the contract expires on April 30. The Icelandic Red Cross lawyers currently provide legal assistance and advocacy services for applicants for international protection in Iceland under the provisions of the contract with the Ministry of Justice. The services are intended to ensure that applicants’ cases “receive just and careful treatment,” according to the Red Cross website. Guðríður Lára Þrastardóttir, one of the Red Cross’ lawyers and leader of the organisation’s team on the issues of applicants for international protection, confirmed that the Justice Ministry has decided not to extend the contract past April 30. Guðríður stated she did not know the Ministry’s plans for providing such services after that date and stated that any future involvement of the Red Cross would depend on contract stipulations. While the Minister of Justice stated that no decision has been made on whether the services will be put out to tender, Guðríður Lára stated that the Red Cross was informed a tender would be launched. She stated the Red Cross would participate “if we possibly can.” The Minister of Justice stated that major changes are in the works in services connected to foreigners in Iceland, which is the reason the Ministry decided not to extend the contract. “Part of the projects in this contract are moving to another ministry. [The Red Cross] has both provided social services for asylum seekers, which now goes elsewhere, to the Ministry of Social Affairs, and also the advocacy services, which we are responsible for.

220,Iceland Review,Human Rights Organisations Criticise Immigration Bill,2022/02/15,"Several human rights organisations, including the Icelandic Red Cross, Unicef Iceland, and the Icelandic Women’s Rights Association, have submitted formal letters criticising an immigration bill that was recently introduced in Parliament for the fourth time. Activist Sema Erla Serdar of the humanitarian aid organisation Solaris states the bill is “a manifestation of systemic racism in Iceland” that aims to “grant protection to as few refugees as possible.” The bill in question was originally drafted in the Ministry of Justice and first introduced in Alþingi, Iceland’s parliament, in 2018, but was not passed at that time. It has been criticised by human rights organisations each time it has been introduced. “This is an attempt by the government to establish a policy that involves significantly constricting refugees, curtailing their human rights, and reducing their possibilities for receiving protection in Iceland,” Sema Erla Tweeted. “The bill especially targets children and other people in a particularly vulnerable situation.” The bill proposes several changes to Iceland’s current legislation governing asylum seekers, including granting police the authority to force physical examinations of asylum seekers. “This is a major encroachment of people’s privacy that does not conform with the law, Iceland’s constitution, or the Icelandic government’s international commitments,” Sema wrote. Along with the above-mentioned organisations, several others have submitted comments on the bill, including No Borders Iceland, the Icelandic division of Amnesty International, the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, the Teachers’ Association of Iceland, and more. In their criticism of the bill, No Borders Iceland point out that the demographic that would be most impacted by the proposed changes does not have the opportunity to read them, as most asylum seekers do not read Icelandic, the only language in which the draft bill has been published. The bill also proposes that the rights of asylum seekers to basic services in Iceland would expire 30 days after a final refusal of international protection is published in their case. The Red Cross criticised this proposal, in particular, stating that it would put asylum seekers in Iceland at increased risk of abuse, human trafficking, and violence. This in turn would increase the burden on police and municipalities, the Red Cross statement asserts.

221,Iceland Review,President Biden Nominates New US Ambassador to Iceland,2022/02/13,"US President Joe Biden has nominated Carrin Patman to be the United States’ ambassador to Iceland, RÚV reports. Patman is a former trial lawyer, currently serves as the chair of the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, and was a major donor to Biden’s presidential campaign. The US’ last three ambassadors to Iceland have all been political appointees and fundraisers for the presidents who have nominated them. Prior to this, Robert C. Barber was appointed by President Barack Obama and Jeffrey Ross Gunter was appointed by President Donald Trump. Over the last few decades, US presidents have generally given the country’s more comfortable ambassadorial seats to political supporters, says Silja Bára Ómarsdóttir, professor of political science at the University of Iceland. The president’s ambassadorial nominations must be approved by the senate. “Today, they look at this as something of a sinecure,” she continued, saying that the opposition party tends to approve political appointees as a sort of quid pro quo. It’s a system that politicians seem largely satisfied with, but among “those who work within the foreign service and have worked their way up, there’s a fair amount of criticism,” said Silja Bára, “and of course within watchdog organizations as well.” Critics argue that “you can buy an ambassadorship.” President Biden has now nominated around 90 ambassadors, 60-70% of whom could be considered political appointees.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
222,Iceland Review,Calls on the Banks to “Lighten the Load” of Households,2022/02/11,"The Minister of Culture and Commerce has called on the banks to “lighten the load” of households faced with rising interest rates. The net profit of Iceland’s three largest commercial banks amounted to approximately 80 billion ISK ($643 million / €564 million) last year, Vísir reports. In an interview published in Morgunblaðið yesterday, Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Culture and Commerce, called on Iceland’s three largest commercial banks to “lighten the load” of families faced with rising interest rates. The Central Bank raised key interest rates by 0.75% on Wednesday, which may strain the finances of households who have signed non-indexed mortgages. The inflation rate in January was 5.7% – the highest since April of 2012 – and the Central Bank predicts an inflation rate of +5% in 2022 (+5.8% in the first quarter), which is double the Bank’s target. According to Lilja, the three commercial banks have recently reaped “super profits” – a total of ISK 80 billion ($643 million / €564 million) last year – which puts them in a prime position to assist young people and low-income families. Íslandsbanki announced 2021 profits amounting to ISK 23.7 billion ($190 million / €116 million) this week. Landsbanki, 95% owned by the government, had previously declared profits of ISK 28.9 billion ($232 million / €204 million) for 2021, and Arion Bank announced a profit of ISK 28.6 billion ($230 million / €202 million) for 2021. Speaking to Morgunblaðið, Lilja invoked the banks’ “civic duty.” “I think it’s imperative that certain households, especially that of young people and low-income families, are not left holding the bag. It would be better for the banks to intervene immediately and tend to these households. If the banks don’t find a solution, I believe that we should reinstate a levy on banks.” Lilja followed up her comments by referring to a levy imposed by former British PM Margaret Thatcher, which sought to harvest around £400m from the banks, for they were seen to be “escaping the pain of that recession”: “In 1981, Thatcher instated windfall taxes to deal with precisely such conditions, to level the playing field among the citizenry,” Lilja remarked. In an article published on Innherji this morning, Guðrún Hafsteinsdóttir, Chair of the Economic and Finance Committee, stated that forcing the banks to spend a portion of their profits to subsidize interest payments would serve to devalue Íslandsbanki shares (the government has yet to sell 65% of its share in the bank). Asked to respond to Lilja’s comments, Guðrún remarked that they had taken her by surprise. “If the government intends to alter the banks’ operational conditions, such a thing must, one way or another, influence the price of the remaining shares in Íslandsbanki. It’s obvious that if the government, as a shareholder, intervenes in such an encumbering manner, the selling price will be affected.” As noted by Innherji, the government expects to sell its remaining 65% of shares this year and the next. The treasury received ISK 55 billion ($442 million / €388 million) when it sold its 35% share in a stock offering of Íslandsbanki last year. Since then, stocks have risen considerably. Innherji estimates that, according to the current market valuation, the government stands to receive up to ISK 160 billion ($1.3 billion / €1.1 billion) for its remaining shares.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
223,Iceland Review,Justice Minister Defends Withholding of Citizenship Applications,2022/02/10,"Receiving Icelandic citizenship through an act of Parliament should be the exception, but it appears to be the rule, Justice Minister Jón Gunnarsson argued in committee today. MPs have criticised the Minister and the Directorate of Immigration for refusing to hand over applications for citizenship that Alþingi, Iceland’s Parliament, was scheduled to process last December. Jón stated that those who apply for citizenship via Alþingi should not get to “jump the line” ahead of others, RÚV reports. Along with the standard process of applying for citizenship through the Directorate of Immigration, Icelandic law permits Alþingi to grant citizenship by decree, which it normally does twice a year. Unlike the standard process, the Alþingi route is open to applicants who do not meet the conditions for the granting of Icelandic citizenship. Applicants who take this route must submit detailed arguments as to why Alþingi should grant them an exemption from these requirements. Read More: Citizenship Applications Withheld from Parliament In an address before the Judicial Affairs and Education Committee this morning, the Minister of Justice stressed that citizenship applications should be treated equally regardless of how they are submitted. He criticised that applications submitted through Alþingi “jump the line” ahead of others, asserting that there is nothing in Icelandic law that requires those applications to be processed first. Jón stated that the processing time for citizenship applications (submitted through the standard process) had been shortened from 18 months to six, and authorities would work to process dozens of applications in the coming days.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
224,Iceland Review,Opposition Abstains from Voting on “Míla Bill”,2022/02/10,"Iceland’s Parliament passed the so-called “Mila bill” today with 33 votes in favour, RÚV reports. Fifteen MPs abstained from voting, all members of the opposition. The bill is intended to ensure national security in light of the sale of Iceland’s telecommunications company Míla to French fund management company Ardian. Míla, which owns and operates nationwide telecommunications systems, was sold to Ardian last year. All of Iceland’s homes, businesses, and institutions are serviced by Míla’s systems, and many expressed concern that such important infrastructure was being sold to a foreign company. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has called telecommunications infrastructure “a key issue for public security in every society.” Read More: Parliament Rushing to Ensure National Security Ardian’s purchase of Míla was discussed in the National Security Council and new legislation was drafted, with the stated goal of strengthening and securing the legal basis for electronic communication with regard to national security. Helga Vala Helgadóttir, MP for the Social-Democratic Alliance, has argued that there were many red flags in the government’s handling of the case and that the legislation did not ensure consumer security. The newly-passed bill, introduced last term by then-Minister of Justice Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir, amends the Electronic Communications Act, legislation governing the Electronic Communications Office of Iceland (ECOI), and legislation on foreign investment in business operations.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
225,Iceland Review,Hope to Remove RÚV from the Ad Market this Electoral Term,2022/02/09,"Minister of Education, Science, and Culture, Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir iterated her position yesterday that RÚV should be removed from the advertisement market. In an interview with Vísir, the leaders of the Independence Party and the Left-Green Movement concurred with the Minister’s conviction. The inclusion of RÚV (the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service) on the advertising market has long been contentious. RÚV has a legal commitment to promoting the Icelandic language and Iceland’s history. It is partly funded by a television license fee, with the rest of its income originating from ad sales. Last year, for example, the government paid out 400 million ISK in grants to 19 privately-owned media outlets, 63% of which went to three major companies. In comparison, government payouts to RÚV increased by 430 million ISK ($3.5 million / €3 million), or from 4.6 billion ISK ($37 million / €32 million) to 5.1 billion ISK (($41 million / €36 million). As reported by Vísir, RÚV’s income currently accounts for approximately a quarter of all earnings by Icelandic media outlets, a figure that hasn’t been higher since the last century. Yesterday, Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir – Minister of Education, Science, and Culture – iterated her intentions of removing RÚV from the advertising market. When asked by a Vísir reporter why the citizenry should take these remarks seriously, given that she had made such declarations in the past – Lilja Dögg announced ambitious plans to remove RÚV from the advertising market in 2019 – Lilja turned the journalist’s logic on its head: “Such statements point to my perseverance, to how determined I am, as a politician; if I think something needs to be done, I don’t stop until it’s done. In those countries to whom we often compare ourselves, the state broadcaster is not on the advertising market.” Referencing the government’s renewed mandate, Lilja stated that the government now had the requisite time on its hands to withdraw the state broadcaster from the ad market. “Of course, this means that we need to bolster RÚV’s operations in some other way, which I’ve previously noted. But it’s clear that the operational environment of local media is unsustainable. We’ve seen a great many people leave the profession. This isn’t good for Icelandic democracy, for politics, for business.” Like Lilja, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Bjarni Benediktsson, is confident that RÚV will be removed from the ad market this electoral term. “I think it’s time that we take this step, and we need to find ways of doing it,” Bjarni stated, acknowledging that the government would need to find a way to ensure RÚV’s operations. “We’re not saying that we need to make drastic cuts to its budget, for we seem to lack the political consensus to decrease RÚV’s scope. Personally, however, I think it’s something that we should be open to reviewing: whether we want RÚV to operate at such a scale for the foreseeable future, as opposed to cutting our coat according to the cloth.” Bjarni added that he is opposed to raising the television licence fee, which he considers a tax and not a premium. “I believe that we should review, during this electoral term, whether we shouldn’t abolish this tax – to relieve households and legal entities of the tax. We need to face the cost of operating a public broadcaster with an item in the budget that clearly states the price.” Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir agrees that RÚV should be removed from the ad market. When asked by Vísir if she was comfortable with the fact that the state of the media had deteriorated during her tenure, Prime Minister Katrín cited government grants and her agreement with Lilja Dögg that the government needed to draw up a long-term, holistic policy for media outlets. “It’s long been my opinion that we should aim toward removing RÚV from the ad market, with the caveat that we need to ensure its operations. We are all of the same opinion, in my party, that we want a vigorous public broadcaster,” Katrín stated, who believes that a strong public broadcaster is vital in a small society like Iceland.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
226,Iceland Review,Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate by 0.75%,2022/02/09,"The Central Bank of Iceland has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. The hike takes the Bank’s key interest rate to 2.75%. In the shadow of rising inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Iceland has decided to raise the Bank’s interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. The Bank’s key interest rate – the rate on seven-day term deposits – will, therefore, be 2.75%. The inflation rate in January was 5.7% – the highest since April of 2012 – and the Central Bank predicts an inflation rate of +5% in 2022 (+5.8% in the first quarter), which is double the Bank’s target. As noted in an announcement this morning, the MPC will not only raise key interest rates but also employ all of its available instruments to ensure that inflation rates subside to target levels within an acceptable timeframe. The increase in interest rates coincides with the publication of the latest edition of the Monetary Bulletin (Peningamál). (The Monetary Bulletin, published on a quarterly basis, contains an “inflation and macroeconomic forecast along with comprehensive analysis of economic and monetary developments and prospects.”) As noted in the Bulletin, GDP growth exceeded November forecasts by 1%; GDP growth in 2021 was 4.9%, and the Central Bank predicts similar growth in 2022. “Jobs have continued to grow, unemployment has decreased, and the production slack that formed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to disappear. There is, however, considerable uncertainty.” The MPC states that inflation outlooks have worsened considerably since the committee’s last meeting. The headline inflation rate has risen to an estimated 4%. Furthermore, inflationary expectations have increased according to several indicators, with the rise in housing prices having a considerable effect, in addition to increases in several items of domestic expenditure. As reported by Kjarninn yesterday, Drífa Snædal, President of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, wrote a letter to the MPC yesterday asking it to refrain from raising interest rates. In her letter, Drífa stated that “sharp increases in interest rates have already put many households in a difficult spot. Many households have committed to non-indexed mortgages, owing both to favourable conditions and to indirect encouragement on behalf of the government and the Central Bank.” The Central Bank will hold a live broadcast at 9.30 AM.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
227,Iceland Review,"Minister Titles Finalised, Changes to Cost ISK 1.8 Billion",2022/02/02,"Is Jón Gunnarsson Iceland’s Minister of the Interior or Minister of Justice? It has been a difficult question to answer since Iceland’s newest government took power in November. The government has not only shuffled ministry appointments, but changed the number of ministries as well as their names and assignments, since last term. RÚV reports that the minsters’ titles have now been finalised by presidential ruling, and the changes are expected to cost the treasury ISK 1.8 billion [$14.1 million, €12.5 million] this term. Six ministers have the same titles as those announced last November. Katrín Jakobsdóttir keeps the title of Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson the title of Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, and Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson the title of Minister of Infrastructure. Willum Þór Þórsson remains the Minister of Health, Ásmundur Einar Daðason the Minister of Education and Children, and Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson the Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. The other six ministers received a new title with the presidential rulings. Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir, originally announced as the Minister of Science, Industry, and Innovation, will now be the Minister of Higher Education, Industry, and Innovation. Svandís Svavarsdóttir will no longer be known as the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, rather the Minister of Food. Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir, originally the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation, will simply be known as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

228,Iceland Review,Sólveig Anna Announces Candidacy for Efling Chair,2022/01/28,"Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, who resigned as Efling’s Chairperson in October, has decided to resubmit her candidacy for the position, RÚV reports. Elections for a new board and chairperson will begin on February 9 and will end on February 15. In October of last year, Efling Union Chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir resigned. Her departure followed on the heels of accusations of workplace bullying, as alleged by union staff in letters of no-confidence to her, the union, and Icelandic media. Sólveig Anna subsequently denied the allegations, and after her resignation, union members stated, in another letter to the media, that what they had wanted was solutions – and not resignations. Following these events, Efling voted in its first chair of foreign origin (on a short-term basis): Agnieszka Ewa Ziółkowska, who previously served as vice-chair of the union. Elections for a new board and chairperson will commence on February 9 and will end on February 15. So far, two other candidates have announced their intentions to run: Ólöf Helga Adolfsdóttir, Efling’s current vice-chair, and Guðmundur Baldursson, Efling board member. In an interview with RÚV, Sólveig Anna remarked that she had decided to submit her candidacy in light of the “numerous encouraging messages” that she had received from union members. Despite these positive messages, Sólveig added that her decision had required careful deliberation: “I still spent a lot of time weighing the prospect, but in the end, having discussed it with good people, we reached this conclusion.” Sólveig Anna will be campaigning under the banner of Baráttulistinn (the Fight List), and states that she is prepared for the campaign: “I’m certainly ready for the fight. Since I first assumed chair of the union, in 2018, I’ve been prepared to fight. Efling has made tremendous strides; we managed to transform this colossal bureaucracy, which enabled the continuation of low-wage policies, into the most powerful tool wielded by Icelandic workers.” As noted in an article in Iceland Review last year, Efling is Iceland’s second-largest labour union, with around 27,000 members working in public service, healthcare, and other industries. Sólveig Anna became Efling’s chair in 2018 and led wage negotiations and strikes among City of Reykjavík employees and hotel workers calling for better wages and working conditions for low earners.

229,Iceland Review,Icelandic Artist Packs Up Exhibition in Russia,2022/02/28,"Contemporary Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson has put a stop to his exhibition Santa Barbara that was taking place in the newly-opened GEC-2 contemporary art museum in Moscow, Russia, RÚV reports. Kjartan says there was no question that packing up the exhibition was the right thing to do after Russia invaded Ukraine last Thursday. Ragnar is an internationally renowned artist, having exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Tate Modern, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, among other places. “It’s not possible to exhibit this piece when this horror has begun,” Ragnar stated. “The piece is about the beginning of the Russia that came to be after the Soviet Union. And that Russia ended [last Thursday]. Now it’s just become a full-blown fascist state.” Ragnar’s piece Santa Barbara is named after the US soap opera that started being broadcast in Russia one week after the fall of the Soviet Union. The exhibition recreates the series one episode at a time under the direction of Ása Helga Hjörleifsdóttir. A team of crew and actors had recreated one episode from the show each day since the beginning of December, until the decision to stop was made last week. The exhibition was originally supposed to run for an additional two weeks.  Read More: Staging Reality Ragnar says Russian artists have told him of being censored or imprisoned due to their art. “It’s just been an incredible experience to make art in this situation, where it’s almost like being in a thriller,” Ragnar stated. “You meet all kinds of people that have been put in prison, experienced bomb threats, censorship and I don’t know what else.” A New York Times article from December describes Russian artist Maria V. Alyokhina’s criticism of the GEC-2 grand opening as “hosting a feast during a plague,” a reference to a play by Alexander Pushkin. “It’s really cool what they are doing, I really like it. It’s just, we have reality also, not only ‘Santa Barbara,’” Alyokhina said, implying the arts centre was ignoring Russia’s political reality. Ragnar is also quoted in the article as saying: “Many things can be criticized in this country, but we cannot look away from the fact that the Russian culture is completely awesome.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
230,Iceland Review,Iceland’s First Eurovision Semi-Final Today,2022/02/26,"Iceland’s Eurovision adventure starts today, Saturday, February 26, with the first Söngvakeppnin semi-final. The show will be broadcast live on RÚV at 7:45 pm local time. As in previous years, there are two semi-finals with five songs competing in each round. The public will vote on their favorite songs in each semi-final and the top two songs from each round will advance to the grand final on March 12. The event organizers also have the option of sending a fifth ‘wildcard’ song to compete in the final. The competition will take place in ‘Söngvakeppnin Hall’ at Trapped director Baltasar Kórmakur’s RVK Studios and be hosted by Björg Magnúsdóttir, Jón Jónsson, and Ragnhildur Steinunn Jónsdóttir. Is this Iceland’s Year? Last year, Iceland sent Daði og gangmagnið with their song “10 Years” to Eurovision. The song quickly became a fan favourite and many speculated that it was finally Iceland’s year to win. The band had already achieved widespread popularity the previous year with their song “Think About Things,” which was Iceland’s submission to the 2020 Eurovision contest. That event was, of course, cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, despite a promising outlook for Iceland’s long-awaited Eurovision triumph, 2021 had other plans in store. A COVID outbreak among band members meant that Daði og gagnamagnið couldn’t compete in either the semi-final or final. A recording of their second rehearsal in Rotterdam was used instead of a live performance and they placed fourth overall.

231,Iceland Review,Audiobooks Account for a Third of Books ‘Read’ in Iceland,2022/02/20,"The popularity of audiobooks in Iceland has exploded in recent years, RÚV reports. A third of books ‘read’ in Iceland are now consumed in audio form. The audiobook boom happened later than anticipated in Iceland, says author and literary scholar Halldór Guðmundsson. When digital music formats became the norm, it was expected that the Icelandic literary world would also naturally shift to digital and audio formats. This didn’t happen, however, in part simply because audiobooks were not being published in any significant way. The Icelandic Audio Library (previously known as the Library for the Blind) made audiobooks available to Icelanders who were unable to read printed material. But their collection was not accessible by the general public. Leaving the Audio Library’s collection out of the tally, therefore, a grand total of nine audiobooks were published in 2017. But just a year later, when Swedish audiobook retailer Storytel arrived in Iceland, audiobook publications skyrocketed, with 168 audiobooks published in 2018. This trend has continued apace: 770 audiobooks were published in Iceland in 2020. A side benefit of this audiobook explosion, says Halldór, is that Icelandic books that have gone out of print are now readily available once again, as production costs are much lower than they would be if the books were republished in print format. He also noted that there are now authors who are have begun writing specifically for audio format, creating, in essence, a new literary genre as they go. “What’s interesting about it is that this could become, and in some cases has already become, its own literary genre: the audiobook. If you’re writing specifically for audio, you have to do things like introduce characters to the story a bit differently. It’s an aesthetics called ‘audio-first.’” Audio books are also bringing many authors new audiences, something that Halldór—who wrote a celebrated, 824-page biography about Iceland’s Nobel Prize for Literature winner Halldór Laxness in 2004—knows from personal experience. “…The big plus is that you get new readers. All of a sudden, people who would have never attempted my doorstop [of a biography] about Halldór Laxness are getting in touch with me, and it takes a whole week to listen to that.” Indeed, the audio version of the biography, read in Icelandic by the author himself, is nine hours and nineteen minutes long. (An English version of the book, translated by Philip Roughton in 2008, was published under the title The Islander: A Biography of Halldór Laxness.) There is still, of course, room for improvement in terms of how authors are remunerated for audiobook publication. It’s a well-known fact, concedes Halldór, that musicians have not been treated equitably in this new digital streaming world and authors are not faring much better. Storytel, for example, only pays authors a little more in royalties than Spotify, “by far the worst” of the streaming platforms, pays its musicians. The company is up front about its payment rates, however, so while Halldór agrees that “author remuneration could be higher, no question,” he notes that there is still payment and the terms are clear from the outset. Platforms like Storytel are pushing Icelandic publishers to release more audiobooks themselves. Looking at the example of Forlagið, the biggest publisher in Iceland, Halldór notes that the company only released a single audiobook in 2017. Whereas last year, Forlagið published 192 audiobooks. This only makes sense, Halldór concludes: you can’t look at the figures — a third of all books in Iceland being read by audio format — and let that sort of opportunity pass by.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
232,Iceland Review,Verbúðin Wins Big at Göteborg Film Festival,2022/02/05,"Icelandic TV series Verbúðin (English title: Blackport) won the 2022 Nordisk Film & TV Fond Prize at the Göteborg Film Festival this week, RÚV reports. The award is given for “outstanding writing of a Nordic drama series” and is accompanied by a prize of NOK 200,000 [ISK 2.85 million; $22,824]. This year’s nominees included Countrymen (Norway; written by Izer Aliu, Anne Bjørnstad), Transport (Finland; written by Auli Mantila), The Shift (Denmark; written by Lone Scherfig), and Vi i villa (Sweden; written by Tove Eriksen Hillblom). Set in the Westfjords in the 1980s, the story follows a married couple, Harpa and Grimur, as they build a small fishing empire along with their childhood friends. But with the introduction of a new quota system in the country, where the fishing grounds are privatised, the struggle for power results in a feud of jealousy, greed and betrayal. Hailed as the buzziest TV series to come out of Iceland since Trapped, Verbúðin has indeed already garnered a great deal of international interest, despite the fact that it has not yet been widely broadcast for the international public. Vesturport produced the show for RÚV in Iceland and Arte France, and has production backing from the UK’s Turbine Studios, the Nordic 12 TV Alliance and the Nordisk Film & TV Fond. Prior to its success at Göteborg, it won the Series Mania Award at the Berlinale Co-Pro Series pitching event in 2018 and was also a hit at the Spanish Serielizados TV festival last fall. Verbúðin has also been extremely popular with audiences at home—80% audience approval according to some figures. But the positive foreign reception of this particularly Icelandic story has been particularly surprising for the creators, says Mikael Torfason, who co-wrote the script with two members of the Vesturport theatre and film company who also star in the series: Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir (The Vallhalla Murders, Trapped), Björn Hlynur Haraldsson (Trapped, The Witcher), and Gísli Örn Garðarsson (Ragnarok, Prisoners). “This is maybe not something you’d expect.

234,Iceland Review,Majority of Icelandic Music Catalogue Sold to Universal Music,2022/01/24,"Iceland’s largest music label, Alda Music, has been bought by Universal Music/Ingrooves Music Group, the largest music corporation in the world, Vísir reports. The head of Iceland’s Musicians’ Union expects the acquisition to give Icelandic musicians “bigger speakers” and open doors for them abroad. The purchase directly impacts the majority of music released in Iceland as well as the local music industry as a whole. Alda Music was founded in 2016 by musicians Sölvi Blöndal and Ólafur Arnalds. The label purchased the rights to a large catalogue of Icelandic music previously belonging to Sena, including the music of current and decades-old hit artists. Alda, and now Ingrooves, hold the rights to 80% of all music released in Iceland, according to the company’s own figures. “In just a few years, Sölvi and his team at Alda have built Iceland’s most powerful distribution network with an incredible roster of local artists,” Bob Roback of Ingrooves stated on the purchase. “We are looking forward to working closely with them as we invest in the local music community and expand opportunities for artists both within Iceland and around the world.” The purchase could help increase value in the Icelandic music by increasing its reach abroad, according to Gunnar Hrafnsson, chairman of the Musician’s Union of Iceland (FÍH). “I think [Icelandic music] has got bigger speakers now. There is more capital behind it and a more powerful company.” Others in the industry may have more reservations about the sale. “Important to think about and discuss this news of a foreign company’s purchase of the distribution rights to a large portion of Icelandic music,” Icelandic musician Logi Pedro Stefánsson tweeted today. “As a small nation with a tiny language we have to stand guard over our cultural wealth and legacy, and how we support the arts as well as possible in the future.” It is clear the purchase will greatly impact the Icelandic music industry, Bragi Valdimar Skúlason, chairman of the Composer’s Rights Society of Iceland (STEF), told Fréttablaðið. “There are of course huge interests at stake here. There is a remarkable catalogue of Icelandic songs from the very start [of recording].” Bragi Valdimar points out that musicians still hold the rights to the songs themselves, though Universal has acquired the rights to the masters (or recordings). This could be positive for STEF, as Universal will invest in distributing the recordings. What impact the purchase of Alda will have is yet to be seen, Bragi Valdimar added, but it is just one step of a development that has been ongoing for some time, and not only in Iceland. “It’s been something of a trend that these independent labels have a tendency to merge together in the end.”","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0
235,Iceland Review,Icelandic Government Raises Artist Salaries,2022/01/13,"Iceland’s government raised its artist grants known as “artist salaries” to ISK 428,000 [$3,330, €2,908] per month this January, Fréttablaðið reports. The salaries were ISK 409,580 [$3,187, €2,782] per month last year. Minister of Tourism, Trade, and Culture Lilja Alfreðsdóttir has decided to increase funding of artists salaries by a further ISK 100 million [$779,000, €679,000] this year and says the government is also considering restructuring the artist salary grant system. “This is not a high figure in my opinion and we aim for it to rise in stages throughout this term because I consider it important for our artists and this system has worked very well,” Lilja stated. “I would say that the entire government agrees with increasing support to this system.” In fact, the 2022 artist salary recipients, who were recently announced, will receive ISK 490,920 per month [$3,825, €3,335]. The government has, however, decreased the number of months granted to artists as compared to 2020 and 2021. An additional 600 months in artist salaries were granted in 2020 and an additional 550 in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The artist salaries for 2022 have however decreased back to 1,600 months in total, the same number granted between 2009 and 2019.  Lilja says the government is considering restructuring the artist salary system, including by having a special category for young artists. Culture and Trade were brought together under a single ministry this term under Lilja’s leadership, and she says that presents certain benefits. “Everything that is connected to culture and art is now in one place. The reimbursement system for literature, the reimbursements for film, recording, so now we have for example the Icelandic Film Centre and the big reimbursement system in one place which creates new opporunities.” Last term, the government abolished sales tax on Icelandic books and increased contributions to writers grants. This term, Lilja says the focus will be on the music and film industries. Lilja says that the government chose to work toward raising artist salaries rather than increasing them in number to “send a message to the entire industry.” She says there is still a ways to go, as salaries in comparable professions average around ISK 550,000 [$4,285, €3,736] per month.","Culture,Politics",0,1,0,1,0,0
236,Iceland Review,"International Book Thief Targeted Icelandic Authors, Publishers",2022/01/09,"The mysterious book thief whose five-year stint stealing unpublished manuscripts has sowed mistrust and anxiety among authors, agents, editors, translators and literary professionals of all stripes also specifically targeted Icelanders and went to great lengths to acquire Icelandic language texts. Following the FBI’s recent arrest of the man suspected of being behind the thefts—Filippo Bernardini, a 29-year-old Italian national who works in the foreign-rights department of publisher Simon & Schuster’s UK office—RÚV reports that the thief’s interactions with Icelandic authors and agents had, in at least one instance, been menacing enough to warrant filing a police report. ‘There’s no apparent reason for it’ The book thief—dubbed ‘The Spine Collector’ by journalists Reeves Wiedeman and Lila Shapiro who spent six months investigating the case—used intricate means of acquiring, or attempting to acquire, unpublished of big-name novelists (Margaret Atwood, Jennifer Egan, Laila Lailami, and David Lagercrantz, the Swedish author who took over writing Stig Larsen’s Millennium series), celebrities (Ethan Hawke), and unknown first timers. The thief’s motives remain unknown and unclear—as pointed out in a 2020 New York Times article, the manuscripts never appeared on the black market and were never followed by any sort of ransom demand. To make things all the more confusing, the individual also targeted authors who write in a variety of languages other than English. By early 2020, it was clear that the thief had set his sights on adding unpublished, Icelandic-language manuscripts to his collection, and although no one was entirely sure why the person would go to such trouble, it put everyone in the industry on edge. “It’s totally worthless material, in the sense that it was in a language that at most, 350,000 people speak,” remarked author Björn Halldórsson at the time. Björn had been contacted by the thief, who posed as an editor at a respected American publisher and asked for a copy of his as-yet unpublished first novel. “There’s no apparent reason for it,” Björn mused in an interview. “But after consulting with people who work for big publishers, I think that this is the first phase in some sort of scheme to build trust and relationships, so god only knows what could have happened if I’d sent the manuscript.” ‘I know where you live’ The thief also contacted Hólmfríður Matthíasdóttir, publishing director at Forlagið, Iceland’s largest publishing house. “He had created email addresses, we’ll call them impostor emails, that mimicked the names of actual people who work in the literary world,” she recalled in a recent interview. “Well-known translators, agents, and publishers, people we were in touch with.” (The thief would often employ tricks such as replacing an ‘m’ with ‘rn’ so that a fake email address—[email protected], for example—would look legitimate unless closely scrutinized.) “He wrote to us using these fake email addresses and asked us to send manuscripts or files for books that we were about to publish,” Hólmfríður continued. “Because he was just so excited to read them and wanted to consider publication abroad.” Hólmfríður saw through the ruse, however, and wrote back to the emailer, suggesting he get in touch with one of the other aliases he’d been using to solicit Icelandic manuscripts. “I say to him, ‘Now, be sure to talk to the other [impostor] because that person has just as much interest in Icelandic literature as you do.” The thief became threatening. “He explicitly said: ‘I know where you live and I’m going to show up there.’” After consulting with her colleagues, Hólmfríður decided to report the interaction to the police. “It’s really unsettling when you don’t know who is behind words like that.” Thief wrote in Icelandic The thief also impersonated a number of Icelanders in the literary world, Hólmfríður herself included. As she recalled in an interview with Morgunblaðið, he wrote to Icelandic author Sjón “in good Icelandic,” pretending to be her. He also emailed Bjartur & Veröld publisher Pétur Már Ólafsson, pretending to be author Hallgrímur Helgason. In that exchange, fake Hallgrímur said he was in Denmark and asked for a pdf of a manuscript that he was interested in reviewing. “I knew that the real Hallgrímur had been on a trip to Germany,” said Pétur Már, “and I found it a bit strange,” not least because Hallgrímur had written a post on Facebook about returning to Iceland. Pétur Már responded to fake Hallgrímur, not letting on that he suspected that something was amiss. He said he’d seen that the author had come back to Iceland and invited him to come to the publisher’s office to pick up the book in person. He also suggested a phone call, but in both cases fake Hallgrímur demurred and repeated his request for a pdf. The impostor maintained his impersonation even after Pétur Már responded with well wishes about his sudden COVID infection—as it happens, the real author had posted on Facebook that very day, saying he’d caught COVID. Pétur Már included a screenshot of the Facebook post in his message to the impostor and said he’d send the book to the quarantine hotel in Reykjavík. “I can’t receive any packages,” wrote fake Hallgrímur. “Only pdfs.” But the real Hallgrímur had not only received the book, he’d called Pétur Már to thank him. Meanwhile, the impostor sent another email: “I haven’t received it…can you send me a pdf?” “That’s strange,” responded Pétur Már, “you just called me before and thanked me for the package!” That was the last that Pétur Már heard from fake Hallgrímur. Interestingly, however, when the FBI arrested Bernardini, the publisher recalled having corresponded with the man under his real name. In that instance, Bernardini addressed Pétur and his colleagues in broken Icelandic. ‘We know nothing about what he was doing’ While no material damage seems to have been done to any of the Icelandic authors and agents targeted by the thief, the person’s campaign of deception has made a real impact on the (Icelandic) publishing industry, which, Hólmfríður pointed out, is one that’s built on trust. Even more unsettling is the fact that ostensibly knowing who was behind the thefts has done little to explain the thief’s motives. “The books, or the manuscripts haven’t appeared on illegal download sites, and we’ve never seen him take advantage of them in any visible way,” noted Hólmfríður. “In reality, we know nothing about what he was doing with these manuscripts.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
237,Iceland Review,"Resturants, Concerts Granted Temporary Slack From New COVID Restrictions",2021/12/23,"Minister of Health Willum Þór Þórsson has decided to exempt restaurants from new infection prevention gathering limits on December 23. Restaurants can accept 50 guests in each compartment instead of 20 as stipulated in the new regulations. Musicians hosting Christmas concerts have also been allowed to host events according to requirements from the previous and milder infection prevention regulation.  Aside from the gathering limits, restaurants must uphold, including closing at 9 pm. The exception is made to ensure proportionality in light of the short notice given until the new regulations took effect. Restaurants are encouraged to continue to keep up the utmost infection prevention measures, including providing access to hand sanitisers, making sure mask requirements are upheld, and keeping up the 1-metre social distance between unrelated parties.  December 23 is known as Þorláksmessa and is a popular day for fermented skate parties at home or in restaurants, people-watching, and last-minute shopping in downtown Reykjavík.  Musicians such as Bubbi Morthens and Emmsjé Gauti have also been granted exemptions to host their Christmas Concerts based on the previous infection prevention regulation requirements. Five hundred people are allowed in each compartment, provided they can present a negative antigen test performed by a healthcare professional no less than 48 hours previous.  In a conversation with Fréttablaðið reporter, Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason has called the exemptions “maybe not the wisest course of action from an epidemiological standpoint.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

239,Iceland Review,New Church To Be Built In Grímsey This Summer,2021/12/16,"The Miðgarðar parish committee in Grímsey recently signed a contract with carpentry workshop Loftkastalinn to build a new church to replace the one that burnt down earlier this year. Architect Hjörleifur Stefánsson has been hired as a construction manager and Arna Björg Bjarnadóttir, project manager of Glæðum Grímsey – a campaign to revitalise habitation in the island – has agreed to supervise the project. Everyone involved in the church building has experience with building restoration projects. The new church will reference the old church but will be larger than the old one due to modern requirements. The design will also take into consideration that the church will be used for other events than church ceremonies. Parts of the church will be prepared on the mainland but the structure is set to be constructed in Grímsey next summer. A notice from the parish committee states that building the new church is a communal project and that the islanders are making every effort to raise funds for the projects. Some funds have already been donated and the people of Grímsey have gratitude for everyone who has already contributed to the project. On January 1, Grímsey had a population of 57 but not all residents live on the island all year round. In recent years, efforts have been made to reverse steady emigration from the island but as of yet, they’ve proven unsuccessful. The island lies off the north coast of Iceland and is the northernmost inhabited part of the country, situated on the Arctic Circle.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
240,Iceland Review,The Number of Self-Employed Workers in the Cultural Sector Decreases by 19%,2021/12/15,"The number of self-employed workers in the cultural sector in Iceland decreased by 19% in the year of 2020, a report by Statistic Iceland confirms. The number had been growing since 2017, but started falling sharply after the pandemic hit in the beginning of last year. In Iceland, self-employed workers are more common in culture and arts than in any other sector. Currently, 23.6% of those who work in culture are self-employed. In comparison, the rate of independent workers in other sectors in Iceland has been around 10% for the past five years. Erling Jóhannesson, the president of the Federation of Icelandic Artists states in an interview with Fréttablaðið, that artists and others who work in culture have found themselves in a precarious situation since the pandemic hit, as these individuals commonly work as freelancers who do not have permanent jobs. “This group of people faced various bureaucratic hurdles and have not been offered proper solutions”. He adds that member societies of the federation are unhappy about the new government’s fiscal policy, in which the government has cut the additional financial support to independent theatre groups which was introduced at the dawn of the pandemic. “We are still trying to make people aware that the situation is not over yet. We are still just trying to keep afloat. The main issue is to reclaim the additional support funds in order to be able to create something; write music, create art,” Erling says. In 2020, 12,700 individuals aged 16 to 74 worked within the cultural sector, or around 6.7% of the entire workforce. The number includes permanent employees. The report demonstrates that the decrease in workers does not apply to permanent employees working in the cultural sector. On the contrary, there has been a slight increase in the number of those with permanent job posts in the cultural sector between 2019 and 2020, or 3.7%.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
241,Iceland Review,Nordic Clinker Boat Traditions Added to the Unesco Intangible Heritage List,2021/12/15,"The creation and usage of Nordic clinker boats has been inscribed by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The inscription is shared by five Nordic countries: Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. Nordic clinker boats have been built by the people in the region for nearly two millennia. The boats are quite small, between five to ten metres [16–33 ft] long and are made from wood. Although the craft of making a clinker boat varies slightly from region to region, the boats are built using the same basic techniques, which is explained as following on UNESCO’s website: “Thin planks are fastened to a backbone of the keel and stems, and the overlapping planks are fastened together with metal rivets, treenails or rope. The shell of the boat is strengthened with frames.” Traditionally, clinker boats were mainly used for fishing and transport. Building a clinker boat required great skill and mastering the craft was a lengthy endeavour. Aspiring craftsmen would commonly start training with a master as young men, sometimes practicing for up to a decade until fully acquiring the skill. The nomination was a result of a joint effort by various Nordic cultural institutions, associations and individuals, which commenced more than five years ago, RÚV reports. Over 200 associations signed the nomination, which was endorsed by all five governments. Sigurbjörg Árnadóttir, chair of The Icelandic Lighthouse Association, says that the organisation had been preparing the nomination for quite some time. “Reaching this milestone is simply wonderful, we are so delighted,” she says. Sigurbjörg says the idea came into being after a series of annual festivals celebrating Nordic coastal culture. The festivals took place in various locations, such as Norway, the Faroe Islands and the Icelandic coastal town Siglufjörður. “During the festivals we shared our knowledge and expertise with other people and quickly realised that the building of Nordic clinker boats is a shared Nordic tradition that has been sustained for millennia,” she says. Sigurbjörg admits that throughout the process, she was optimistic that UNESCO would accept the tradition to their list of intangible heritage. “We prepared the application very well and got many associates on board with us”. Although the usage of Nordic clinker boats has changed throughout the years, UNESCO reports that the tradition is still of great significance. Today, the boats are mostly used for ceremonial purposes, such as festivities and sporting events.    ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

All of the books are currently printed in Reykjavík, but Birta hopes one day to set up a printing press in her basement so the books could be made on site. Birta says her working relationship with Skriða is a good one. “It’s genuinely gratifying and fun.

According to new figures published by the Icelandic Literature Center, a third of the nation read five (or more!) books in the past month and 68% gave someone a book in the last 12 months. While interest in literature and reading remain high, however, there is a growing number of Icelanders who read “little or not at all.” This is the fifth year in a row that the Icelandic Literature Center has conducted a survey on Icelanders’ reading habits in conjunction with six other literary organisations in the country, including the Reykjavík City Library, Reykjavík UNESCO City of Literature, and the Writers’ Union of Iceland. As last year, this installment also focused on the impact that COVID-19 has had on locals’ interest in literature but found that the pandemic is no longer having a significant impact on Icelanders’ reading habits. Results showed that Icelandic men are reading less this year (1.5 books/month), while women are reading as much as they did before (3.1 books/month). On average, the nation reads an average of 2.3 books a month. People aged 18-24 read significantly less than people in older age brackets. A healthy majority of Icelanders, or 79%, believe that it is important for Icelandic literature to have financial support from the government, which is an increase from last year, when 73% were in agreement about this. Icelanders still read ‘traditional’ books, with 78% saying that they’ve read a physical book in the last 12 months. This is down somewhat from last year, during the height of the pandemic, when 83% of respondents said they’d read a physical book. Audiobooks remain as popular as they were last year, with 46% of respondents having listened to one in the last year. Only 31% had read an e-book. Icelanders still mostly prefer to read in Icelandic: 29% only read in Icelandic, while 28.8% read in Icelandic more often than they read in other languages. 19.5% read in other languages just as often as they read in Icelandic, 19.6% read in other languages more often, and 3% only read in other languages. In the same vein, 80.5% of the nation believes that it’s important for works of foreign literature to be translated into Icelandic.

246,Iceland Review,Lókal International Theatre Festival Begins,2021/11/27,"The Lókal International Theatre Festival began on Friday and will continue through Monday, December 6. This year’s program features seven works by local artists, some of which are still in development, as one of the festival’s emphases is works in progress. The lineup also includes one piece by renowned international theatre-makers 600 Highwaymen. This year’s festival will also see the publication of Syrpa, a collection of sample scripts by artists based in Reykjavík. Syrpa will be available for sale at Tjarnarbíó for the duration of the festival. The program schedule, curated by artistic directors Eva Rún Snorradóttir and J. Vala Höskuldsdóttir, is varied in subject matter and approach, and reflects the festival’s interest in “gut feelings” and giving artists “opportunities to try new things.” It also reflects an imaginative understanding of what theatre and performance actually is and prioritizes active audience participation. Take, for instance, Saturday’s Botanical Expansion Tour, a 4-hour trip to the Reykjanes peninsula during which participants will develop “a plant-oriented worldview that comes in handy when dealing with global warming, midlife crisis and everyday stress.” Saturday will also stage “The Festival of Impermanence,” during which “a nurse, a poet, and musicians come together to celebrate and explore the work of healing” in the home of one of the performers. Another of the festival’s performances can be experienced from the comfort of the audience’s homes and will continue for the duration of the festival. As part of “Call Center,” which begins at 5pm on Sunday, November 28, three short performance pieces will be delivered over the phone. Participants can call whenever they like, as often as they like, from anywhere. The phone number for the performance will be announced on Sunday, see the Facebook event page for details. Most of the performances are in Icelandic, but two will be held in English. On Wednesday, December 1, visual artists Lukas Bury and Weronika Balcerak will present “They have no pictures on the walls,” which is “an artistic research project that aims at in-depth research of the Polish immigrant community in Iceland.” The lunchtime lecture is free to attend, but pre-registration is required (more information here). The three-part performance “A Thousand Ways,” has been performed in phases throughout the world. During Lókal, theatre-makers 600 Highwaymen respond to our “already-strained coexistences and interactions,” which have been “further fractured and flattened by virtual gatherings” and offer the audience “a new chance at making contact with a stranger.” This performance requires direct participation: “You and another person, seated at a table, separated by a pane of glass, a stack of cards between you. A new type of theater emerges.” (More information and tickets here.) The full program of events can be found on the Lókal website, in English, here.

247,Iceland Review,“Everything About the Immigrant Experience In Iceland In Poetic Form”,2021/11/24,"Una publishing house recently released Pólifónía af erlendum uppruna, a collection of poetry by immigrants to Iceland. The book features fifteen different poets from nine different countries exploring aspects of their immigrant experiences. A press release proclaims that “it’s high time that the voices of immigrants are heard in Icelandic literature and this book is a good start.” The concept was conceived by editor and one of the featured writers Natasha Stolyarova in collaboration with Una publishing house. After reading the work of Danish-Palestinian poet Yahya Hassan, she wondered about the lack of immigrant voices in Icelandic literature. During times of gathering limitations due to the pandemic, she rounded up some active poets and writers in Iceland – all immigrants to Iceland. “I knew around half of the writers already,” Natasha told Iceland Review. “The others were recommended to me when I shared the idea for the project.” “We first met in the summer of 2020,” she continues. “Sometimes in person and other times over zoom, when the pandemic was raging.” They passed around notes of open-ended questions about their experiences in Iceland, of the country, the language, the people, and their interactions with them. This inspired some of the poets to write new work, while others submitted older work they felt fit the theme. “It’s everything they had to say about their experience as an immigrant in Iceland, in poetic form.” Even though the work is now complete, the group is now working on promoting the book and attending poetry readings and literary events during the so-called Christmas book flood. “So much has happened since we started this. People have moved away from Iceland and back again. Two of the poets have had children!” Natasha tells me. The book is intended for Icelandic readers. All the featured poems are in Icelandic, some were written in Icelandic while others appear in the original language as well as Icelandic translations. With writers from 11 countries – including Russia, Italy, Colombia, Serbia, Denmark, Finland, India, Poland, the US, and Canada – the book has poems in languages such as English, Portuguese, and Finnish, and one poet even writes in their own version of the Icelandic language and developed their own script.

250,Iceland Review,Icelandic Language Day Celebrated,2021/11/16,"Today is Icelandic Language Day, celebrated in Iceland annually on November 16. The goal of the day is to remember the importance of the Icelandic language within Icelandic society and celebrate its past, present, and future. Icelandic is an Indo-European language, belonging to the group of Germanic languages. This group also includes Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Faroese. Of these languages, Faroese and Norwegian are the most closely related to Icelandic. The Icelandic language is notable for its relative stability over the past millennium: modern Icelandic speakers can read and understand the Icelandic sagas, written around a thousand years ago. Icelandic Language Day will be celebrated today with an official program of events in the National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavík. The events include the presentation of the Jónas Hallgrímsson Prize and will be streamed live on the government website. November 16 was chosen for the holiday as it is the birth date of Jónas Hallgrímsson (1807-1845). Jónas was an Icelandic poet and translator and a strong advocate for Iceland’s independence from Denmark. Iceland Review regularly covers stories related to the Icelandic language, including why many foreigners struggle to learn Icelandic and the future of Icelandic language technology.

251,Iceland Review,Sigrún Pálsdóttir Wins 2021 EU Prize for Literature,2021/11/12,"Writer Sigrún Pálsdóttir was awarded the European Union Prize for Literature (EUPL) on November 9. The EUPL honours a single writer per participating country once every three years. Sigrún Pálsdóttir is the fourth Icelandic author to receive the prize. The European Union Prize for Literature (EUPL) was established in 2009 and is an annual initiative to recognize the best emerging fiction writers in Europe. The EUPL also aims to “promote the circulation and translation of literature amongst European countries.” For authors to be eligible for the prize, their country must participate in the Creative Europe Programme, which currently includes over 40 countries: the 28 EU member states, the three EEA countries (including Iceland), the candidate and potential candidate countries for accession to the EU, and the European Neighbourhood Policy countries. The EUPL is organized into three-year cycles. Each year, national juries comprised of experts in literature, publishing, and bookselling are organized into a “rotating third of the participating countries.” After settling on a shortlist of two to five books from their nation’s most promising writers, each jury selects its national winner. As noted on the EUPL’s website: “all participating countries are thus represented across cycles of three years, with the prize awarding one winning book/author per country.” The 2021 EUPL award ceremony was held on November 9 at the culture house Flagey in Brussels, Belgium. Thirteen authors from 13 different countries were recognized. This year, the jury selected writer and historian Sigrún Pálsdóttir as its Icelandic winner (the award had previously been announced in May of this year). Sigrún was honoured for her 2019 novel Embroidery (also been translated as Runaround and the Nonsense Trip), which revolves around a 19th-century Icelandic woman named Sigurlína: “She disappears from Reykjavik, along with a historical relic from her father’s collection. Through a series of incredible events, the artefact is unveiled at The Metropolitan Museum of New York.” As noted in the jury’s review, “Embroidery is the product of an author who has achieved mastery of both form and style … the narrative is concise and lean … and the novel is at once original and modern but at the same time incredibly accessible and fun.” Sigrún Pálsdóttir is the fourth Icelandic writer to win the EUPL. Previous winners are Halldóra K. Thoroddsen, Oddný Eir Ævarsdóttir, and Ófeigur Sigurðsson. According to the EUPL’s website, each laureate of the EUPL receives 750,000 ISK (€5,000 / 5,700$) and their awarded book is given support for translation and promotion. “A EUPL anthology is also published every year, which features excerpts from all laureates’ awarded books both in the original language and in an English or French translation.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
252,Iceland Review,Skyr Exhibition Opens in Selfoss,2021/10/27,"The history of skyr production and consumption is the subject of a new exhibition that was just opened in Selfoss, South Iceland. Called Skyrland, the exhibition tells visitors the story behind Iceland’s characteristic dairy product, from the first settlers to the 21st century. The exhibition is located in Selfoss’ newly built city centre in the same building as a food hall. At Skyrland “You’ll discover how 40 generations of women passed their skyr-making knowledge down, from mother to daughter, and how the story moved from isolated turf-roofed farms, to the world,” the exhibition’s website states. The exhibition features stops for all senses, including a “story wall,” an immersive scent exhibit, and even a tasting session for those who want to try the delicacy. Skyr is a high-protein, low-fat, cultured dairy product. It is technically a cheese but it is consumed like a yogurt. Skyr has a sour flavour and is produced and sold commercially with added flavouring like blueberry or vanilla. It has been a staple of the Icelandic diet for centuries and is even mentioned in a number of Medieval sagas. Cultural historian Hallgerður Gísladóttir has suggested that skyr was produced across Scandinavia at the time Iceland was settled, but the tradition was lost elsewhere after that period.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
253,Iceland Review,Glíma: Icelandic Wrestling Applies for UNESCO Status,2021/10/26,"Icelandic wrestling, known as glíma, could soon be on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage, RÚV reports. The sport involves wrestlers gripping their opponent by the waist and attempting to throw them to the ground. Glíma was brought to Iceland by Norwegian settlers. Though originally opponents held onto each other’s trousers, in 1905 a special belt or harness was introduced to the sport, allowing wrestlers to have a better grip on each other. The sport is known for emphasising technique over force and was featured in a demonstration at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Guðmundur Stefán Gunnarsson teaches glíma in Njarðvík, Southwest Iceland. He is working to get the sport onto UNESCO’s official list of intangible cultural heritage. It recently reached the first milestone in that process, which is to be registered as Icelandic cultural heritage. According to Guðmundur Stefán, the atmosphere of glíma is very positive and competitions are characterised by respect among athletes. Heiðrún Fjóla Pálsdóttir, an award-winning glíma competitor who teaches alongside Guðmundur, agrees. “There’s such incredibly good morale in Icelandic glíma. Everyone is friends and it’s always so much fun.” More information about glíma is available in English on the website Lifandi hefðir (Living Traditions).","Culture,Sport",0,1,0,0,0,1
254,Iceland Review,46 Years Since First Women’s Day Off in Iceland,2021/10/25,"Yesterday marked 46 years since Iceland’s first “Women’s Day Off,” when women left their workplaces and took to the streets to protest the gender pay gap. Around 25,000 women attended that first protest in Lækjartorg square, which sparked similar movements around the world. Women’s average salary in Iceland is still just 77.2% of men’s average salary, according to the newest figures from Statistics Iceland. The first Women’s Day Off was held in 1975, and five more protests have been organised in Iceland since then: in 1985, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2018. No public protest was held this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though the Women’s History Archives held a feminist history walk yesterday in downtown Reykjavík. Despite legislation intended to ensure equal pay, Iceland’s gender pay gap persists. As of last year, women still filled less than 25% of CEO and chair positions in Icelandic businesses and the proportion of women on boards for companies with more than 50 employees was just under 35% in 2019.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0
255,Iceland Review,"The Norse Settled in North America 1,000 Years Ago, Research Shows",2021/10/22,"In an article in Nature published yesterday, researchers claim to have determined the precise date of Nordic settlements in Newfoundland. By employing a novel dating technique, researchers provide evidence that the wood used in the construction of timber-framed buildings in L’Anse aux Meadows was cut in AD 1021. It’s widely accepted that the Norse people arrived in North America long before Christopher Columbus. Despite the general acceptance of this theory, there has been only one confirmed Norse settlement site in the Americas: L’Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Since the latter half of the 20th century, extensive field campaigns have been conducted at the site, with much knowledge having been gleaned about the settlement and its contemporary environment. The precise age of the site has never been scientifically established; most previous estimates have been based on analysis of architectural remains, artefacts, and interpretations of the Icelandic sagas. According to a new article published in the journal Nature, however, researchers claim to have discovered the precise age of the settlement in L’Anse aux Meadows. By employing a novel dating technique – which uses a solar storm in 992 as a reference point – researchers were able to analyze the tree rings of wood from timber-framed buildings on the site (widely thought to have belonged to Vikings) to determine that the wood was cut in AD 1021. This means that the Norse arrived in North America 471 years before Columbus. As noted in the article: “Our result of AD 1021 for the cutting year constitutes the only secure calendar date for the presence of Europeans across the Atlantic before the voyages of Columbus. Moreover, the fact that our results, on three different trees, converge on the same year is notable and unexpected. This coincidence strongly suggests Norse activity at L’Anse aux Meadows in AD 1021. Further evidence reinforces this conclusion.” This article was updated at 21:33.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
256,Iceland Review,Lamb to Be Iceland’s 2022 Oscar Submission,2021/10/18,"The Icelandic Film and TV Academy has chosen Lamb to be Iceland’s submission to the 2022 Academy Awards, or Oscars, RÚV reports. Lamb (titled Dýrið in Icelandic) has already snagged two nominations and one award at Cannes and is already the highest-grossing Icelandic film to be screened in the United States. The film is directed by Valdimar Jóhannsson, who wrote the script alongside Icelandic author Sjón. Lamb stars Noomi Rapace and Hilmir Snær Guðnason, who play María and Ingvar, a childless couple in the Icelandic countryside who discover a mysterious newborn on their farm. While at first, “the unexpected prospect of family life brings them much joy,” it ultimately destroys them. The jury of the Icelandic Film and TV Academy praised the film’s strong imagery and originality. “From the first moment, the viewer is captured and hypnotizes through a mysterious and exciting adventure,” the jury wrote. Their statement called the film a “careful study of human nature, sorrow, and loss.” Lamb is currently showing in Icelandic theatres.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
257,Iceland Review,Trapped Season Three Premieres in Iceland,2021/10/18,"There’s something for both local and international viewers in the third series of popular Icelandic TV show Trapped, which premiered in Iceland last night. Familiar faces from Iceland’s music and media scenes will impress Icelanders with their handling of minor roles while beautiful landscape shots will charm Icelandophiles abroad, the guests of a new RÚV podcast on the series argued. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson stars as usual in the role of Detective Andri, this time investigating a murder committed on the property of a religious cult in North Iceland. The creators of Trapped began working on the third season of the show as early as December 2018. Filming finally began in Siglufjörður, North Iceland in September of last year. Shooting was subject to COVID safety protocols: cast and crew had their temperature taken daily when arriving on set, and a COVID safety supervisor was on set at all times to make sure distancing and mask-wearing regulations were followed. Among the musicians featured in the show is former Eurovision singer turned yoga teacher Ingibjörg Stefánsdóttir, who is convincing as a meditation guide at the cult. Rock DJ Andrea Jónsdóttir, well-known to locals in Iceland, appears in a bar scene, while hip-hop artist Flóni also appears in the show.

258,Iceland Review,Impostor Poets Make Impressive International Debut,2021/10/17,"Fríða Ísberg and Þóra Hjörleifsdóttir, two members of Iceland’s Impostor Poets collective, are catching the attention of readers around the world. Þóra’s novel Magma (translated by Meg Matich), was included on Oprah’s list of the 21 best books in English translation to be published in fall 2021. And translation rights to Fríða’s Merking (The Mark) were sold to five countries before the book had even been published in Iceland. Narrated in elegantly spare, visceral language, Magma tells the story of 20-year-old Lilja, whose whirlwind love affair with a charismatic, confident, and self-important classmate quickly and almost imperceptibly turns abusive. “In impressionistic, mesmerizing chapters, Hjösleifsdóttir [sic] dives deep into the fire-rivers of lust,” Hamilton Cain at Oprah Daily concluded, “[and] just how much humiliation we’re willing to tolerate in the name of love.” Magma also caught the attention of book reviewer Tammy Tarng, who included it as one of the New York Times’ Globetrotting picks this summer, while reviewers Annabel Gutterman, Cady Lang, and Raisa Bruner at Time named it as one of the “36 Books You Need to Read This Summer.” Merking is a work of speculative fiction that is centered around the Empathy Test. According to its supporters, the test can establish whether the taker is a moral and compassionate person, while its detractors believe that it is an unjust infringement on privacy and autonomy. The novel was only just published in Iceland this week, but prior to its publication, has already found homes in five other countries around the world: Laffont in France, Hoffman & Campe in Germany, Gyldendal in Denmark, Norstedts in Sweden, and De Geus in The Netherlands. Magma and Merking are both Þóra and Fríða’s first novels. Fríða previously published two poetry collections and a collection of short stories that was nominated for the Nordic Council Literary Prize. Along with the other four members of their Impostor Poets Collective, Þóra and Fríða have also co-authored three books of poetry and a novel, Olía (Oil) which came out in Iceland this month as well.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
259,Iceland Review,New Film Casts Iceland’s Polish Community in New Light,2021/10/15,"Wolka arrives in Icelandic theatres today, RÚV reports. The Polish-Icelandic production made its debut at this year’s Reykjavík International Film Festival and is the last film made by director Árni Ólafur Ásgeirsson, who died last spring at the age of 49, just three months after being diagnosed with cancer. Wolka tells the story of a Polish woman who has just finished a 15-year sentence in prison for murder. For reasons known only to herself, she breaks parole and travels to Iceland in search of a woman. The film, Árni Ólafur’s fourth, was in the works for some time—almost a decade, in fact. Árni Ólafur, who was married to Polish set designer Marta Luiza Macuga, had lived in Poland and wanted to make a movie about Polish society in Iceland. After moving back to Iceland, he met screenwriter Michal Godzic. They began working on the script together and nine years later, the film is finally ready for audiences. In addition to its debut at RIFF, a special screening of Wolka was also held in the Westman Islands. “It was certainly emotional for my son and I,” said Marta. “It was so strange to be there without Árni. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to the Westmans. Wherever I went, I felt like Árni should be there with us. It was easier here in Reykjavík, the team was with me so it was more bearable. I could enjoy it more and celebrate the movie coming out. It’s done and people will appreciate it.” Olga Bołądź, one of Poland’s most prominent film stars, played the leading role of Anna. “I met Árni Ólafur in Poland,” she recalled. “He called and asked if I wanted to play Anna. I read the script and fell for it, it was such a beautiful role that offered up so many possibilities. I said yes—yes, thank you. He was one of the most remarkable directors I’ve ever worked with.” Filming in the Westmans during the winter was difficult, Olga noted, but she recalled it positively. “It was hard because of the weather, it was freezing. But Iceland is such a beautiful country and the people friendly and showed me such kindness, especially the Poles because everywhere I went, I met Poles. They were really proud that there was a film being made about Poles who live in Iceland. I hope that they’ll like it.” Olga believes that Wolka is a story that will have a broad appeal. “The film is part mystery and part adventure, but it is also a family drama. I think that everyone can relate to family drama.” And while the story may have particular significance for Poles living in Iceland, Olga believes that it will expand people’s notions about this community. “The story is certainly about Polish society [in Iceland], but it shows it in a new light. Árni wanted to show that Poles are not just a labour force, but also people with feelings, who laugh and cry. We are normal people like all other nations.” An earlier version of the article falsely stated that Árni passed away last year. ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
260,Iceland Review,"Arnaldur Turns to History, Not Crime, This Christmas",2021/10/15,"World-famous author Arnaldur Indriðason will not be putting out a new crime novel during this year’s jólabókaflóð, or Christmas Book Flood, mbl.is reports. Arnaldur has released a new book every November 1st for the last 24 years, and his crime novels—whether they star Detectives Erlendur, Konráð, or Flovent and Thorson—are a particularly popular part of the season. This year, however, Arnaldur is trying something new and releasing a work of historical fiction. Many of Arnaldur’s novels are set in the past, but on top of being distinctly un-criminal in nature, his new book, Sigurverkið (a title which can mean both ‘Winning Entry’ and ‘Watchworks’) moves to an entirely new era. It takes place in the southern part of the Westfjords in Iceland and Copenhagen, Denmark during the 18th century and tells the story of Jón Sívertsen, an Icelandic watchmaker working in a Danish palace to restore magnificent, old clock. One day, the King himself, Christian VII, comes into the Jón’s workshop. Although still king in name, Christian, who suffers from mental illness, has been sidelined by his son and court. In the course of their conversation, Jón tells Christian about his father and foster mother, who were killed at the behest of the previous monarch. In his interview with Morgunblaðið, Arnaldur said that the idea for the story “came to me very suddenly. I got the idea for the book last summer and immediately sat down to write and finished it in about six months.” The book takes inspiration from real people and events, although Arnaldur has combined and refigured details to suit his narrative. And as the era is not one that he’s written before, he enlisted the assistance of a historian while writing. “It was a lot of fun for me to write about the 18th century because it is, of course, a new arena for me as an author, but it’s also an interesting possibly new arena for contemporary Icelandic literature.” Arnaldur says that he wants to continue to surprise himself as a writer, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he’ll be writing a lot more historical fiction from here on out. He’s not sure what the future holds on that count but will be making a return to crime fiction soon. “Konráð, the rather skewed protagonist of my last books, will be in full swing next Christmas,” he said. “That I can I promise.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

263,Iceland Review,Iceland’s Culture Industry Needs More Support,2021/10/05,"The 2008 banking collapse and the coronavirus pandemic have impacted Iceland’s culture industry more negatively than other industries. There are 25% fewer people working in culture in Iceland today than there were in 2008. The data are from a report published by the Icelandic Confederation of University Graduates (BHM) today. BHM emphasised the importance of a government policy that increases support for the arts in order to avoid permanent damage from the pandemic. According to the report, there has been a sharp decline in wage payments and the number of people working in the creative industries in Iceland in recent years. There are 25% fewer people working in the culture industry now than in 2008, while the total decline in wage payments amounts to 40%. The creative industries began to decline significantly after 2013, and the contraction increased significantly after 2017. While COVID-19 is an obvious factor, the development in Iceland’s culture industry precedes the pandemic. In the last four years, total salary payments in the media industry have decreased by around 45%; in the film industry by 41%; and in the music sector by 26%. While the development began earlier, the economic shock of the pandemic made the situation go from bad to worse, the report states. BHM points out that most artists have a university degree under their belt. Despite their education, however, artists’ salaries were considerably lower than the average salaries of others working full time in 2020. Artists’ salaries have fallen far behind the general wage trend and now compare to the lowest salaries on the Icelandic job market. While the wage index has risen by 96% in recent years, artists’ salaries have risen by 49%. Low wages could explain contraction in individual sectors, such as in the publishing industry. While in 2011, 5.2 books were published in Iceland per 1,000 inhabitants, that number fell to 3.4 in 2019. BHM says Iceland’s government can look to the Nordic countries as an example of how to increase support for the arts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Otherwise,” the report states, “there is a risk that cultural industries will suffer permanent damage from the pandemic.”","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0

It will be the first art museum dedicated to a woman artist in Reykjavík. For the past months, work has been done to finalize contracts, register museum assets, compose a charter, and to settle inheritance issues in preparation for the founding of the Nína Tryggvadóttir Art Museum. Last Thursday, Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson, on behalf of the City of Reykjavík, and Una Dóra Copley, Nína Tryggvadóttir’s only daughter, signed a formal agreement at the Höfði House in Reykjavík. The museum will be housed in the eastern part of Hafnarhúsið. As the western half of the building houses the Reykjavík Art Museum, the entire building will now be dedicated to the arts. The agreement provides that Una Dóra Copley will donate over a thousand works of art by Nína Tryggvadóttir that reflect the artist’s entire career. The art in question includes paintings, drawings, glass art, and watercolours. Additionally, Una Dóra will bequeath real estate in Manhattan and Reykjavík to the City of Reykjavík, along with other works of art, a library, and more. Nína Tryggvadóttir (1913-1968) was known primarily as a painter, although she also composed and illustrated children’s books. She was born on March 16, 1913 in Seyðisfjörður and died on June 18, 1968. As a young artist, she studied drawing under the tutelage Ásgrímur Jónsson. Alongside her studies at the Reykjavík Women’s Gymnasium, Nína studied art at the Academy of Finnur Jónsson and Jóhann Briem. She later studied painting at Det Kongelige Akadmi for de Skønne Kunsten in Copenhagen. Nína lived in Paris, London, and New York but always maintained a close connection to Iceland, where she held many private exhibitions. She was an active member of the abstract expressionist movement in New York, and her art can be found in museums and private collections around the world. On Thursday, the City Board of Reykjavík announced that it would call for ideas and perspectives on a design competition to renovate Hafnarhús to house the Nína Tryggvadóttir Art Museum, to expand the premises of the Reykjavík Art Museum, and to create space within the building to be dedicated to painting and other art-related activity.

267,Iceland Review,COVID-19 in Iceland: Free Rapid Tests Possible Key to Looser Restrictions,2021/09/17,"Public health insurance will cover the cost of rapid antigen tests as of September 20, including those required by private organisations such as concert venues. The aim is to increase the public’s access to rapid antigen tests and enable more parties to offer testing free of charge. Current domestic COVID regulations allow events of up to 1,500 guests provided attendees undergo rapid testing. Iceland’s Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason told Fréttablaðið that rapid tests could be the key to a more open society in the coming weeks. When the pandemic began, Icelandic health authorities at first used exclusively PCR tests to screen for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rapid antigen tests were approved for use much later and have only come into general use in recent weeks for border testing and for individuals who are not required to quarantine but may have been exposed to the virus. New domestic regulations came into effect on September 15, raising the general gathering limit from 200 to 500 people. Events with up to 1,500 guests are permitted if all guests supply negative rapid test results. “In order for the introduction of rapid tests to serve its purpose of increasing people’s opportunities to attend a variety of events and pursue cultural activities, it is important to have easy access to rapid tests and that their cost is not cumbersome,” a government notice states. The capital area healthcare service has offered rapid testing at Suðurlandsbraut 34 in Reykjavík, and other public healthcare centres offer rapid testing in various regions of the country. Private providers currently offer rapid tests at BSÍ, Kringlan, and Kleppsmýrarvegur in Reykjavík; Aðalgata 60 in Reykjanesbær; and the University of Akureyri in North Iceland. The regulation comes into effect on September 20 and is valid until the end of this year.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
268,Iceland Review,“The story continues:” Historic Iðnó Reopens Tomorrow,2021/09/17,"One of Reykjavík’s most historic buildings, theatre and event space Iðnó, will reopen tomorrow, putting an end to a closure that lasted nearly one and a half years. The venue’s new managers promise it will stay open from morning till night and welcome locals and visitors of all ages. The venue was forced to close in May 2020, around two months after the COVID-19 pandemic reached Iceland. Iðnó reopens with a bang tomorrow, September 18, offering a full program of children’s events during the afternoon and live music in the evening. Iðnó (or Iðnaðarmannahúsið as it is rarely called), was built in 1896 and was first home to the Reykjavík Theatre Company, one of the country’s oldest cultural organisations still in operation. The building has been a hub of cultural activities for decades and has housed many a historic event, including a party for Christian X, King of Denmark, when he visited Iceland in 1921. The venue’s new management has freshened up the building, including removing carpets to reveal original flooring and putting on a fresh coat of paint. Guðfinnur Karlsson of Prikið, Iðnó’s head manager, told Vísir the venue’s doors will be open to all. “It’s not just for members of Parliament. This is the house of the people, and never more so than now.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

270,Iceland Review,Icelandic Thriller Blackport Takes Grand Prize at Series Mania 2021,2021/09/03,"The Icelandic TV series Blackport won the Grand Prize at the 2021 Series Mania festival yesterday. Blackport will premiere on RÚV on December 26 and is produced by Vesturport in collaboration with RÚV, ARTE France, and Turbine Studios. Based in Lille since 2018, Series Mania is a festival dedicated solely to European TV shows. This year marked the first in-person iteration of the festival since 2019. During the festival’s award ceremony yesterday, the Icelandic TV series Blackport (Verbúð) was honoured with the Grand Prize in the International Competition. “We’re on cloud nine,” actress Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir remarked, speaking to Iceland Review from her home in Reykjavík this morning. “We’re incredibly happy to have been accepted to the festival; we were competing with big productions, from the likes of HBO, so we weren’t exactly expecting to win. Being honoured with the grand prize far exceeded our expectations.” As noted by Screen Daily, Blackport is a “political thriller set in a once-thriving fishing port hit by quota restrictions in the mid-1980s.” Created by Nína Dögg Filippusdóttir, Gísli Örn Garðarson, and Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, the series – mainly shot in Suðureyri and the Greater Reykjavík area – entered into production last summer and wrapped in August. “It’s been a long road, complicated by COVID-19; we shot part of the series in Hull and Grimsby, but travelling there last winter proved difficult in light of the pandemic,” Nína Dögg stated. The actress plays the lead role in the series along with Björn Hlynur Haraldsson. Blackport also features Gísli Örn Garðarsson, Unnur Ösp Stefánsdóttir, Hilmir Snær Guðnason, Ingvar E. Sigurðsson, Steinunn Ólína Þorsteinsdóttir, and Selma Björnsdóttir. Blackport is produced by Vesturport in partnership with RÚV, ARTE France, and Turbine Studios. The series comprises eight episodes and will premiere on RÚV on December 26. “Before the premiere, we’ll be taking it to Mipcom in October and to another festival in Barcelona. From there, the ball will start rolling,” Nína Dögg stated.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
271,Iceland Review,Iceland Airwaves Postponed Until 2022,2021/09/02,"The Iceland Airwaves music festival has been postponed until 2022 due to ongoing social restrictions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival will take place November 2-5 2022. Since the Delta variant reaches Iceland, social restrictions limiting gatherings of more than a couple of hundred people have been in place. According to a press release from Sena Live, which operates the festival, these restrictions make festivals such as Iceland Airwaves “Everything concerning rapid tests and festival guest’s access to them is still unclear. Other events (standing room and without rapid tests) continue to be limited to 200 people or fewer in each compartment. Read More: What’s the Status Of COVID-19 In Iceland? The most recent relaxations of the social restrictions due to the pandemic allow for 500 people to gather but they must remain in numbered seats, can’t face each other and have to wear masks until they sit down. Additionally, they must be able to present the results of a rapid test taken no less than 48 hours before the start of the event. “raising the gathering limits to 500 people in numbered seats on the condition of rapid tests is a step in the right directions,” the notice reads, “but these limitations are still too restrictive to larger, standing events, and make it impossible to host events such as the Iceland Airwaves.” The notice states that ticketholders who want to attend Iceland Airwaves next year won’t need to take any action, their tickets will still be valid. Those who wish to be refunded can contact TIX by Friday, September 17. “We encourage ticket holders to keep their tickets.

272,Iceland Review,Alma Nominated for Nordic Council Film Prize,2021/08/26,"Icelandic film Alma, written and directed by Kristín Jóhannesdóttir, is Iceland’s nominee for the 2021 Nordic Council Film Prize. The award is accompanied by a prize of DKK 300,000 [ISK 5.9 million; $47,471] to be split equally among the screenwriter, director, and producer, and is given annually to a film from one of the five Nordic nations. The winner will be announced in an awards ceremony in Copenhagen on November 2. Per the Icelandic Film Centre, Alma is “the story of a young woman who is serving time in a psych ward for murdering her boyfriend, a crime she can’t remember. But when she discovers [he] is still alive, she decides to escape and kill him after all.” Rather than repeating typical tropes, however, the Icelandic selection committee noted that Alma allows its protagonist space for growth and healing. As they wrote in their nomination, “What starts out as a noirish revenge fable becomes a beautiful love story that centers around the process through which a victim of abuse finds her way through trauma and grief to finally rediscover her roots and her distinctive voice.” “Employing biting humor as well as striking visual imagery, Alma deftly combines an intense poetic vision and a socially critical feminist angle.” Alma is Kristín Jóhannesdóttir’s third feature (Rainbow’s End and As in Heaven) and was produced by Gudrún Edda Thórhannesdóttir, Fridrik Thór Fridriksson, and Egil Ødegård. It stars Snæfrídur Ingvarsdóttir, Kristbjörg Kjeld, Emmanuelle Riva, and Hilmir Snær Gudnason. Iceland has won the Nordic Council Film Prize three times since it started being awarded in 2002. Director Benedikt Erlingsson has won twice, for Of Horses and Men in 2014 and Woman at War in 2018, and Dagur Kári won for Virgin Mountain in 2015.

The project, dubbed KIOSK 108, is the brainchild of Czech artist Monika Fryčová, who decided to turn her attentions outward during lockdown and find a way to make a meaningful contribution to the local community. The plan? To take an abandoned ship’s wheelhouse and convert it into a ‘cultural kiosk.’ “When the COVID situation came, I thought it’s very useless for me to sit behind [my] computer and wait [to get] sick,” Monika explained. “So, I start[ed] to think about how I can make public art for outsiders and local people, to make something meaningful with this object.” Monika plans to serve light meals and drinks from the converted wheelhouse, including fish soup, hot dogs, coffee, and beer. She’s using old timber to build a small bar inside the cabin where people can sit and look out the window onto the fjord. She’s also plans to create a kid’s corner for children to play in and have a stage on the roof where musicians and artists can perform. Monika is selling KIOSK 108 stickers and t-shirts to raise money for the project, which has also received a grant from Uppbyggingarsjóður Austurlands, the East Iceland Development Fund.

275,Iceland Review,Cat Power Covers “I Think of Angels” for New Sean Penn Film,2021/08/20,"Today, August 20, marks the release of Sean Penn’s new film Flag Day. The soundtrack to the film comprises 13 songs, among them a cover of “I Think of Angels” – originally composed by Icelandic musician KK – as performed by American singer-songwriter Cat Power (Chan Marshall). Flag Day, written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (Edge of Tomorrow), premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this summer. The film stars Sean Penn, who also directs the film, and his daughter, Dylan. The film has received mixed reviews. As noted by Pitchfork, the film’s soundtrack features eight songs composed by Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and Glen Hansard (The Frames, the Swell Season), in addition to a cover of the Icelandic “I Think of Angels” by Cat Power (Chan Marshall). “I Think of Angels” was composed by KK and performed in collaboration with his sister, Ellen Kristjánsdóttir. The song pays tribute to the siblings’ late sister, Inger, who died in a car crash in America in 1992. “I Think of Angels” was officially released in 1995 on the album Gleðifólkið. The song is often performed at funerals in Iceland. In an interview with Mbl.is, KK revealed that the producers of Flag Day reached out to him about two years ago: “I just said Yes, and then there were a few twists along the way, before, finally, it was decided that Cat Power would perform a cover of the song.” According to KK, Valdís Óskarsdóttir – who edited the film in collaboration with Michelle Tesoro – suggested “I Think of Angels” to Sean Penn, and the director fell for the song immediately. KK is over the moon with Cat Power’s performance, sung an octave lower than the original, which he calls “divine.” Readers can listen to the song below.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
276,Iceland Review,Iceland University of the Arts to Receive Permanent Home,2021/08/12,"The Iceland University of the Arts (Listaháskóli Íslands, or LHÍ), will be uniting all of its departments in a single, specially-designed facility in the Tollhúsið building in downtown Reykjavík, Iceland’s cabinet announced in a press conference this week. LHÍ has operated its departments in several disparate facilities since its inception in 1998. A design competition will be launched this autumn where participants will aim to show how all of the university’s operations can be consolidated under a single roof in Tollhúsið. Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson announced the decision at a press conference on the Suðurnes peninsula last Tuesday, where the cabinet also presented several other measures in support of the arts. The initiatives include establishing a research centre for the creative industries at Bifröst University and the Creative Iceland project, which would work on advancement within the creative industries in Iceland as well as their export. At the conference, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir pointed to research showing that Iceland’s creative industries make a significant economic contribution to Iceland, while also stating they have immeasurable value toward forming the nation’s identity. Located near Reykjavík’s Old Harbour, Tollhúsið was designed by Gísli Halldórsson and completed in 1970. Its original design included a harbour warehouse on the ground floor and a customs office for cruise ship passengers arriving in the harbour. After Sundahöfn harbour came into operation, however, activities at the old harbour decreased. The building features a mosaic by Gerður Helgadóttir from 1973 depicting the harbour activities before the construction of Tollhúsið. The street below the mural is now under construction to transform a parking area into a pedestrian square.","Culture,Politics",0,1,0,1,0,0
277,Iceland Review,Stolen Artefacts Returned to Icelandic Museum 50 Years Later,2021/08/10,"Three artefacts have been returned to Glaumbær Museum in North Iceland by post more than 50 years after they were stolen, RÚV reports. The museum staff was at first perplexed by the package, which contained no letter or explanation. They eventually contacted the sender in Germany, who had a strange explanation for the return of the items. Last week Glaumbær Farm and Museum received a package from Germany in the post. The museum, a preserved turf farmhouse from the 18th and 19th centuries, often receives gifts in the post, though they are usually accompanied by letters explaining the origin and significance of the items enclosed. “There were three things in the package: a creamer, a butter tub, and a small backgammon checker, which is like a chip for backgammon. There was no explanation with them, no letter or memo,” stated Inga Katrín D. Magnúsdóttir, project manager at Byggðasafn Skagfirðinga (e. The Skagafjörður Settlement Museum), to which Glaumbær belongs. “[…W]e didn’t understand a thing but the more we thought about it and the more information we found here at the museum, the more exciting it became.” A search in a database revealed more information about the objects. “The creamer, it was so familiar that we started to suspect that maybe it was possibly from here and then we went into our database, sarpur.is, and searched for the items we thought it resembled and then it came to light that there was an entry for this creamer and a comment had been written under it: ‘Disappeared from the museum July 23, 1970’.” The museum staff decided to contact the sender who offered an interesting explanation for the items’ return. “He told us this story, that he had found these artefacts at a flea market many years ago and with the explanation that they were from Glaumbær in Skagafjörður. And now he was getting old and his descendants didn’t want to have them so he had decided to send them back now.” Asked whether it was likely the man had stolen the items himself and returned them out of guilt, Inga Katrín stated only: “That may very well be.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

The city’s pride parade has been cancelled for the second year in a row due to COVID restrictions. Nevertheless, festival board member Ragnar Veigar Guðmundsson says there will be a variety of pride events this year that will offer a little something for everyone. “The week will be full of queerness wherever there’s room for it,” Ragnar Veigar stated in a radio interview this morning. “Of course the festival has a slightly different format compared to a normal year but we know how it has to be done in order to fall within the pandemic restrictions.” The festival programme features everything from educational events that will be streamed online to drag performances and a drag brunch held in Gamla Bíó theatre. “For example, there’s a very interesting educational event this afternoon, a conversation between generations, in Mál og menning bookstore. Three individuals of different ages will be there talking about their queer experience around the age of 20. It’s just going to be a relaxed event with a good discussion,” Ragnar Veigar says. Preparation for this year’s pride parade was in full swing when COVID restrictions were reimposed on July 24.

279,Iceland Review,Westmans Postpone Þjóðhátíð,2021/07/28,"Þjóðhátíð, the festival held in the Westman Islands every Merchant’s Weekend and one of Iceland’s biggest multi-day events, has been postponed, although organizers still hope to hold it later this summer. This was announced by festival committee chair Hörður Orri Grettisson on the Þjóðhátíð website on Monday. The postponement comes as a result of tightening restrictions aimed at stemming the exponential rise of recent COVID-19 infections, including a ban on gatherings of more than 200 people. Previous Þjóðhátíðs have drawn as many as 16,000 attendees—nearly four times the population of Heimey, the island the festival takes place on. As recently as last week, organizers said they had no intention of cancelling the festival, and that “precautions with personal infection control” and regular sanitation would be sufficient. See Also: Domestic Restrictions Reimposed in Iceland Organizers have asserted that the festival, funds from which support ÍBV [the Westman Islands football club] is vital to not only ÍBV’s youth programming but also the Westmans’ local economy. They have, as such, not given up on the idea of holding the festival this year. “It is our belief that it will be possible to hold the festival in some form later this summer. A decision will be made no later than August 14.” In the meantime, those who bought tickets have three options: they can receive a refund in August, donate the price of their ticket to ÍBV, or transfer their ticket to next year’s festival in 2022. A slimmed-down and virtual version of the festival will also take place.

280,Iceland Review,No Plans to Cancel Þjóðhátíð,2021/07/21,"There are no plans to cancel this year’s Þjóðhátíð, a festival held annually on Merchant’s Weekend on Heimey Island in the Westman Islands, RÚV reports. In spite of a recent uptick in positive COVID-19 cases around Iceland and tightening measures to prevent a more serious outbreak, authorities have yet to impose any gathering bans that would prevent organizers from holding the festival, which is one of the biggest multi-day events in Iceland. In past years, it’s drawn as many as 16,000 attendees—nearly four times the population of Heimey. “We are determined to put on this Þjóðhátíð,” said chair of the festival committee Hörður Orri Grettisson. “From here out, just as up until now, this all depends on us. We have to take precautions with personal infection control, sanitize often, and do it well. This is how we’re going to prevent ourselves from getting infected.” Hörður says that ticket sales and planning, which have been underway since the start of the year, have been successful thus far. Organizers are assessing the situation on a day-by-day basis in meetings with Westman Island police and civil defense authorities, he continued. But if the festival had to be cancelled for the second year in a row, it would have serious economic consequences for Westman residents and businesses, Hörður said. “It would, naturally, be a devastating blow, particularly for ÍBV [the Westman Islands football club]. This is by far their biggest fundraiser. All their work with children and teens depends on this festival going well.” The financial consequences would also extend to companies based in other places around Iceland, Hörður continued. (Indeed, among other things, the weekend necessitates an uptick in both ferry crossings to the Westmans and short flights booked with tour companies to the island.) “Tourism, restaurants, etc—many of them live or die with this weekend. People have probably booked in for the weekend and such. So [cancelling] would just be a devastating blow.”","Culture,Travel",0,1,0,0,0,0
281,Iceland Review,Icelandic Film “Lamb” Double-Nominated in Cannes,2021/07/14,"An Icelandic supernatural drama directed by Valdimar Jóhannsson, Lamb (Dýrið), received its world premiere yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival in France. The film has been nominated for the festival’s Golden Camera Award as well as the Un Certain Regard Award. It is Valdimar’s first feature film as a director and he told RÚV it is a dream and an honour that the film was chosen for the festival. Lamb follows a childless couple, María and Ingvar, as they “discover a mysterious newborn on their farm in Iceland. The unexpected prospect of family life brings them much joy, before ultimately destroying them,” according to the film’s plot summary on IMDb. Along with directing, Valdimar wrote the script for the film in collaboration with Icelandic author Sjón. The film stars Swede Noomi Rapace and Icelander Hilmir Snær Guðnason in the leading roles. Noomi lived in Iceland as a child but this is her first role in Icelandic. The actress revealed that she learned to deliver a lamb for the role. “I was taught by an Icelandic farmer but he went quite fast,” Noomi stated in an interview with France24. “I got a knock, he was like, ‘There’s a lamb coming!’ And I had to run down to the farmhouse and basically put my hands inside of the sheep and pull out a baby lamb.” She called the experience “amazing. I saw life begin and how this amazing, beautiful creature stood up for the first time and started drinking after two or three minutes.” “We’re just finding our footing after this wonderful reception that the film received,” stated Sara Nassim, one of the film’s producers, after the premiere. “There was a full house and a standing ovation at the end of the screening. We hope people liked the film. All of the responses so far have been very good, there’s been a lot of talk about the film.” Lamb’s Icelandic premiere is expected this fall.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

The event was one of the first projects of the region’s newly-minted LGBT+ association Hinsegin Vesturland. The organisers say they are overjoyed with the turnout and hope to change the discourse on LGBT+ issues in the Icelandic countryside. The sister Guðrún Steinunn and Bjargey Anna Guðbrandsdóttir are among the finders of the association and organisers of the local pride festival. “This is so, so much bigger than we ever expected,” Bjargey told RÚV. “When [Guðrún] started talking about this idea a few years ago we imagined one float and walking with our family on the float. I don’t even know how many people are here, it’s wonderful.” Alexander Aron Guðjónsson is another one of the event’s organisers. Asked about the importance of holding an LGBT+ festival in the countryside, he answered: “There is a slightly different rhetoric here in the countryside about LGBT+ people. So it’s very positive to do this in as many places as possible so that there is an open discussion about everything and everyone, everywhere.” The West Iceland LGBT+ Association (Hinsegin Vesturland) was founded in February of this year. North Iceland and East Iceland also have regional LGBT+ associations.

283,Iceland Review,Puff-Inn Welcomes Seabirds for Five-Star Stay,2021/07/07,"A new hotel is opening by the small town of Borgarfjörður eystri, East Iceland, but if you’re reading this article, its lodgings are probably not available in your size. The Lundahótel, or Puff-Inn, is a project hatched by illustrators Elín Elísabet Einarsdóttir and Rán Flygenring, offering luxury accommodations to Iceland’s most beloved birds. Iceland Review spoke to the artists as they were putting the finishing touches on the facilities, located at the farmstead Höfn, just east of the town. The two artists opened a puffin shop last year at the same location, an answer to Iceland‘s many tourist shops filled with puffin-themed tchotchkes. “We made all sorts of puffin-related merchandise that was not for sale and were thinking a lot about the relationship between puffins, people, and puffin stores,” Rán told Iceland Review over the phone. “Opening a hotel is a logical continuation of that.”  A post shared by Nýlundabúðin (@nylundabudin)  “The puffin is the symbol of tourism in Iceland but it’s in danger,” Elín says, explaining that human-caused global warming is pushing the bird’s food source north and the puffins are following. “A hotel would be a good way to provide them with refuge.” Early birds can dine on the hotel’s breakfast buffet, complete with sardines and herring (humans are also welcome), and guests will enjoy all the usual offerings of luxury lodgings: “Bathrobes and postcards.” The Puff-Inn is located by the town harbour across the road from a puffin colony, and the artists admit their new facilities are more of a “staycation” for the birds. Their feathered neighbours are nevertheless are showing interest in the hotel on their doorstep, say the two illustrators, as are the local townsfolk. While there are currently no rooms available for human guests, Rán says they’re welcome to make a booking for a friend of the puffin persuasion. Rather than the traditional rooms, the Puff-Inn offers burrows to its guests. “We plan to offer burrows of various sizes so birds of all kinds can come and stay,” Elín adds. “All birds are facing difficult circumstances due to human causes, so we hope they all stop by for a visit.” Interested people and avians can follow the hotel on Instagram.","Culture,Nature",0,1,1,0,0,0

Vigdís Finnbogadóttir was the first woman to be democratically elected head of state, in office from 1980 to 1996. At a commemorative ceremony yesterday, marking the University of Iceland’s 110th anniversary, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Transport and Local Government Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, and President of the University of Iceland Jón Atli Benediktsson signed a joint letter of intent to open an exhibition on the presidency of Vigdís Finnbogadóttir next year. According to the agreement, the government will aid in preparatory efforts for the exhibition, which will be housed at Loftskeytastöðin – Iceland’s first radio station, inaugurated on June 17, 1918. Loftskeytastöðin, which is located next to Veröld – the House of Vigdís, will also accommodate research and academic facilities. The agreement stipulates that the exhibition receive an annual subsidy from the treasury. The University of Iceland will manage the exhibition and related scholarly activities, both of which will be integrated within the operations of Veröld. The signees hope to inaugurate the exhibition next year. “Vigdís’ influence on Icelandic society, especially on those who grew up during her presidency, can hardly be overstated: waking up, one morning in June of 1980, as the first nation in history to have democratically elected a woman as head of state. In an incredibly brief time, Vigdís managed to unite the nation. The prevailing attitude at the time was that a president should be a symbol of unity, and in Vigdís the nation quickly found such a symbol,” PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated in a speech during the ceremony. Having wished Icelanders happy National Day, and congratulated the University on its anniversary, Vigdís announced that she would be donating various keepsakes from her presidency to the University of Iceland, including letters, gifts from foreign heads of states, and clothing. These items will serve as the basis for the exhibition at Loftskeytastöðin. As noted in an interview with Iceland Review in 2019, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir always considered herself “one of the people.” Even after being elected president, Vigdís continued visiting the public pool in West Reykjavík, where she would join fellow swimmers in a regimen of quaint exercises invented by the former Danish gymnastics educator J.

The fictional drama takes place in Vík í Mýrdal, South Iceland, during a volcanic eruption so intense it starts melting a glacier from which “mysterious elements” start to emerge “with consequences no one could ever have foreseen.” Katla is the first Icelandic television series produced by Netflix in collaboration with Reykjavík Studios. Containing ten episodes, the series was written by Baltasar along with Sigurjón Kjartansson, Davíð Már Stefánsson and Lilja Sigurðardóttir. Lilja and Baltasar also directed the series alongside Börkur Sigþórsson. “It’s an idea I got quite a long time ago and was playing around with,” Baltasar told RÚV. “What if the glaciers would melt and we have no idea what’s under them. Then it developed. I knew it wouldn’t be easy because it’s heavy in production.” Then Baltasar received a call from Netflix and the idea suddenly became a real possibility. Baltasar describes Katla as a combination of folktale, science fiction, and psychological “noir mystery,” a form he says provided lots of freedom. “We stuck to a certain realism in terms of what the situation would be like after one year of a volcanic eruption. But then we let go of the reins and it was as if the team filled with energy, it was a lot of fun.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
286,Iceland Review,"Aladdin, Elsa, and Moana Speak Icelandic Again",2021/06/04,"Streaming service Disney+ has made some popular Disney films available with Icelandic dubbing, Vísir reports. Earlier this year, Education Minister Lilja Alfreðsdóttir and actor Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson called for the company’s films to be made available with Icelandic dubbing and now, films like Aladdín (Aladdin), Ísöld (Ice Age) and Herkúles (Hercules) are available in Icelandic. Jóhannes Haukur criticised Disney+ on Twitter earlier this year for making the content available in Iceland but only in English, despite the existence of Icelandic dubbing. Hey @disneyplus why would you sell subscriptions in a region (Iceland to be specific) without making the subtitles and audio for that region available? Why oh why? Iceland has dubbed Disney features and TV shows for decades. You own it, you have it. Please make it available. — Jóhannes Haukur (@johanneshaukur) January 30, 2021 
Minister for Education and Culture Lilja Alfreðsdóttir responded to the subsequent discussion by reaching out to Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek, challenging them to make the films available in Icelandic. The company responded positively, stating that in a few months’ time, popular films such as The Lion King, Toy Story, Frozen, Wall-E, Cars, and Coco would be available with Icelandic dubbing. Today, at least ten Disney films are available in Icelandic: Aladdín, Ísöld, Vaiana, Hin Ótrúlegu (the Incredibles), Zootropolis, Bílar, Ríó 2 og Epic as well as Soul, which for a long time was the only film on the streaming service available in Icelandic.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
287,Iceland Review,Sigur Rós Members Acquitted in Tax Fraud Case,2021/05/25,"All members of the Icelandic band Sigur Rós were acquitted this morning by the Reykjavík District Court in an extensive tax evasion case, RÚV reports. Jón Þór Birgisson, the bands lead singer, was also acquitted on charges of tax evasion in connection with his company Frakkur. The band’s legal costs amounting to ISK 56 million ($463,000/€378,000) will be paid by the State Treasury. All of Sigur Rós’ band members except Kjartan Sveinsson were charged with committing major tax fraud by submitting incorrect tax returns between 2011-2014. Kjartan, who left the band in 2013, was charged with submitting incorrect tax returns in 2012 and 2014. Jón Þór (Jónsi) was also charged for tax evasion via his company Frakkur. Throughout the case, the band members have maintained their innocence and said that they had, in good faith, left their financial affairs to an accountant who mishandled them. The band fully co-operated with the tax investigation and paid all charges and fines, yet still faced additional punishment through the District Prosecutor, who has now acquitted them. The band released a statement in October last year decrying the injustice of Iceland’s legal system, which allows for parties to be charged and tried twice for the same offence. Sigur Rós received this year’s Honourary Award at the Icelandic Music Awards for their contribution to Icelandic music over the past 17 years. The band was established in 1994 and is one of the most internationally successful Icelandic music acts of all time.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
288,Iceland Review,Iceland Lands Fourth in 2021 Eurovision Song Contest,2021/05/25,"Iceland’s representatives in the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest, Daði og gagnamagnið, landed in fourth place at the competition despite a COVID-19 infection in the band that prevented its members from performing live. A second member of the band tested positive for COVID-19 upon arriving home in Iceland: Árný Fjóla Ásmundsdóttir. Iceland has only twice done better in the Eurovision Song Contest: the country won second place in 1999 with the song All Out of Luck performed by Selma Björns, and also in 2009 with the song Is It True, performed by Jóhanna Guðrún. Iceland also reached fourth place on one previous occasion: in 1990 with the song Eitt lag enn, performed by Stjórnin. After a COVID-19 infection came up in the Icelandic delegation early last week, the entire group was put into quarantine. The first infection was diagnosed in a crew member, but a band member later tested positive that week. Daði og gagnamagnið decided to use the recording from their dress rehearsal as their submission in the semi-finals of the competition last Thursday, and qualified for the finals, held on Saturday night. Iceland landed in fourth place, with 378 points: 198 from the jury and 180 from the public. Most of the Icelandic delegation arrived home in Iceland on Sunday, when a second member of the band tested positive for COVID-19: Árný Fjóla, frontman Daði Freyr’s wife. Daði and Árný are now in isolation together and have announced they plan to use the time to make a music video. Fans can vote on which song they’d like to see realised on Daði’s Twitter page.

289,Iceland Review,Second COVID-19 Infection in Iceland’s Eurovision Delegation,2021/05/19,"Update May 19, 12:54: The EBU has released a statement confirming that Daði og gagnamagnið will neither perform at the Thursday semi-finals nor the Saturday finals of the 2021 Eurovision Songcontest. A recording of their second rehearsal in Rotterdam will be used as their entry. One of the members of Daði og gagnamagnið, Iceland’s representatives in the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest, has tested positive for COVID-19. Daði himself announced the development this morning on Twitter. The band will consequently not perform in the Eurovision semi-finals tomorrow night and a recording from their second rehearsal will instead be used as their entry. In a tearful video posted in Gagnamagnið’s Instagram stories, band member Jóhann Sigurður Jóhannsson came forward to tell fans he is the member who tested positive. “I’m really shocked and disappointed and generally just really sad about the whole situation,” Jóhann stated, adding that he did everything he could to stay safe. The Icelandic delegation entered quarantine and underwent testing earlier this week after an infection arose in the Polish Eurovision team. Jóhann is the second member of the Icelandic group to test positive – the first is a crew member and not a performer. Jóhann assured supporters that he was healthy but disappointed as the group had worked so hard and the performance had been “so long in the making.” In a Twitter thread from this morning announcing the development, Daði Freyr stated that the band was “very happy” with the taped performance that will be used on Thursday night and “super excited” for supporters to watch it. A member of Gagnamagnið got a positive test result this morning. Unfortunately this probably means that we will not take part in the rehearsal today or live show tomorrow and a recording from our second rehearsal will be used in stead. pic.twitter.com/93yravOHSY — Daði Freyr 🥑 (@dadimakesmusic) May 19, 2021  The Eurovision finals take place on Saturday.

290,Iceland Review,No Further Infections Detected With the Icelandic Eurovision Delegation,2021/05/18,"No further members of the Icelandic delegation for the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam tested positive for the coronavirus yesterday, RÚV reports. The whole group was tested for the virus after a member of the Icelandic crew tested positive the previous day. The infected individual is not a member of the on-stage group. The Icelandic delegation will be tested again on Wednesday and Thursday morning and if no further infections are detected, Daði and Gagnamagnið will perform at the jury show on Wednesday evening and the second semi-finals on Thursday night. Head of the Icelandic delegation Felix Bergsson stated that the infection is a reminder to continue to be careful despite their vaccinations but the whole delegation was vaccinated before departing for the Netherlands. Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason has stated that the infection despite the vaccination does not surprise him, it occurred only 10 days after the individual in question received his shot of the Jansen vaccine but it takes two or three weeks for the vaccine to reach full efficacy.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
291,Iceland Review,Daði to Compete Despite Eurovision COVID-19 Outbreak,2021/05/17,"Daði og gagnamagnið, Iceland’s representatives in the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest, will compete in the competition’s semi-finals in Rotterdam this Thursday despite a COVID-19 outbreak in which members of the Polish and Icelandic teams have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, RÚV reports. One member of the Icelandic crew tested positive for COVID-19 and the others are quarantining as they await their test results. If the band is unable to perform live, a recording from their dress rehearsal will be used as their semi-final entry. The competition is taking place in the Netherlands, currently a high-risk area for COVID-19 according to the European Centre for Disease Control. Vísir reports that Icelandic national broadcaster RÚV, who sponsors Iceland’s participation in the competition, requested that the crew be vaccinated before departure to the Netherlands. “And we granted that,” Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason told the outlet. “People are being sent out there on behalf of the Icelandic state where [the virus is widespread]. We have been reluctant to grant such requests but we did so in this instance.” Just under 40% of Icelandic residents have received one or both shots of COVID-19 vaccine, and authorities are still administering the jab to priority groups including school staff and people with underlying illnesses. Þórólfur admitted that some might consider it unfair to let the group jump the line due to the Eurovision trip. The Icelandic Eurovision crew received the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) single-dose vaccine around ten days ago, shortly before departing for Rotterdam. One member of the crew has now tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which does not surprise Þórólfur. “It’s only been ten days since the vaccination. We know it takes two to three weeks for the vaccine to reach full efficacy.” The infected individual is not part of the on-stage group but has been in contact with them.

Daði and gagnamagnið’s song 10 Years was in sixth place before the group took the stage at Rotterdam’s Ahoy Convention Centre but had risen to fourth only a few hours later. Daði Freyr and his band won fans across the world in 2020 with their song Think About Things, Iceland’s submission to the 2020 Eurovision contest, which was eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the rehearsal, the band premiered new costumes, graphics, and instruments – the latter designed by band member Árný Fjóla (also Daði’s wife and the subject of the song), and constructed by Árný, Daði, and Daði’s father. The band’s graphics reference previous Eurovision performances, including that of Icelander Jóhanna Guðrún, who represented the country at the 2009 contest, and Ukrainian artist Ruslana’s 2004 contest-winning song Wild Dances.

293,Iceland Review,First Day of Summer in Iceland Today,2021/04/22,"Today, April 22, is a national holiday in Iceland known as the First Day of Summer (Sumardagurinn fyrsti). In the old Icelandic calendar, this holiday likely marked the beginning of a new year and was celebrated by giving presents. Despite its name, it doesn’t always bring Icelanders warm weather. While winter is officially over according to the old Icelandic calendar, it is not uncommon to have snow, hail, or freezing temperatures across Iceland on the First Day of Summer. In 1949, the highest recorded temperature in the country on the day of the holiday was -0.2°C (31.6°F), and Reykjavík was blanketed with 4cm (1.6in) of snow. This year’s weather forecast for the holiday includes precipitation across West Iceland – rain in lowland areas and snow at higher elevations in the region. Temperatures will reach a high of around 10°C [50°F] during the day and around freezing at night. “We are the only nation in the world that’s celebrated its own particular first day of summer for 1,000 years,” ethnologist Dr. Árni Björnsson told Iceland Review. “Our ancestors created their own calendar before they knew of the Roman calendar. They split it into two halves: summer and winter.” There are clues suggesting that the First Day of Summer was considered the first day of the year. Ancient Icelanders calculated people’s age by the number of winters they had lived through, a practice that is still upheld in the countryside with horses and other domestic animals.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
294,Iceland Review,Fagrahraun or Fagradalshraun: New Reykjanes Lava Field Awaits a Name,2021/04/21,"The town council of Grindavík, Southwest Iceland has narrowed down around 339 name suggestions for the new lava field at Fagradalsfjall to just two: Fagrahraun and Fagradalshraun. RÚV reports that both options have been submitted to the authority that approves new place names in Iceland. The many craters at the eruption site, which has been active for over a month, will also be named Fögrugígar or Fagradalsgígar, depending on which name is chosen for the field. Grindavík authorities organised a competition between March 31 and April 9, 2021 where the public was allowed to submit suggestions for what to name the new lava field. “The conclusion was that after reviewing the ideas that were received, which were 339, evaluating and weighing it, that the lava field should be called either Fagradalshraun or Fagrahraun,” stated Grindavík Mayor Fannar Jónasson. The two names are similar in meaning. While Fagrahraun translates as “beautiful lava” or “beautiful lava field,” Fagradalshraun references Fagradalsfjall, literally “beautiful valley mountain,” located at the site. The name also references the volcanic system Fagradalsfjallskerfi, one of the volcanic systems beneath the Reykjanes peninsula. Dalahraun (E. valley lava field), Geldingadalshraun (E. Geldingadalur lava field), and Ísólfshraun (E. Ísólfur’s lava field; after an early settler once believed to be buried there) were among the most popular suggestions for the field, which continues to grow one month after the eruption began. Some name suggestions referenced the ongoing pandemic, including Kórónahraun and Covidhraun, while the suggestion Ölmuhraun was intended as a tribute to Iceland’s Director of Health Alma Möller. None of those suggestions made it past the town council’s deliberations. The town council is now waiting on an official opinion on both place name suggestions.","Culture,Nature",0,1,1,0,0,0

296,Iceland Review,50 Years Since First Icelandic Manuscripts Were Returned from Denmark,2021/04/21,"Today marks 50 years since the repatriation of two of Iceland’s most important medieval manuscripts. The Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda (Konungsbók Eddukvæða) and the Codex Flateyensis (Flateyjarbók) were returned to Iceland from Denmark on this day in 1971, a remarkable and symbolic event in Iceland’s history. Now a state-of-the-art building is under construction in Reykjavík that will be a new home for Iceland’s most valuable manuscripts. President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and Minister of Education and Culture Lilja Alfreðsdóttir will lay the cornerstone of the building today, which will be named the House of Icelandic Studies, in honour of the momentous anniversary. The Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda is widely regarded as the most remarkable of all old Icelandic manuscripts. It is the sole source for most of the poems it contains, many of which are important sources for the worldview and religious beliefs of pre-Christian Scandinavians. The codex was discovered in 1643 and sent as a gift to King Frederick III of Denmark in 1662. It was kept in the Royal Library in Copenhagen until 1971, when it was brought back to Reykjavík by ship. It was accompanied by the Flateyjarbók, the largest medieval Icelandic manuscript, containing mostly sagas of the Norse kings as well as accounts relating to the Vinland colony, the Orkney Islands and the Faroe Islands.

We all have a shared duty to preserve, research, and distribute these national treasures to new generations,” stated Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Education and Culture.

297,Iceland Review,Iceland Symphony Orchestra Accompanies COVID-19 Vaccination Today,2021/04/20,"Some 5,000 people who will receive a dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Reykjavík’s mass vaccination centre today will be serenaded by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra while they get their jab, Vísir reports. The ISO contacted vaccination officials and asked if they could play a concert at the centre, and the offer was readily accepted. People of all ages with underlying chronic illnesses are being vaccinated in Reykjavík today. Around 8% of Iceland’s population has been fully vaccinated while a total of 19% have received at least one shot. The first priority groups to be offered vaccination were frontline workers and nursing home residents, followed by the oldest demographics. Now over 95% of residents over 80 have been vaccinated and most residents over 70 have received at least one dose. This week authorities are vaccinating residents with underlying chronic illnesses in all age groups. Iceland is administering COVID-19 vaccines from three manufacturers: Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna. “This is a very large group overall, but we have started on the lists of people with the most serious illnesses, this is about 30,000 people in the Reykjavík Capital Area so it will take us a few weeks or the next few weeks to work through this group,” stated Ragnheiður Ósk Erlendsdóttir, Director of Nursing at Capital Area Healthcare Centres. While those vaccinated today will receive the Pfizer vaccine, others with chronic illnesses that are scheduled to get the jab tomorrow will receive the Moderna vaccine. The 60-70 year old demographic (without underlying illnesses) will be offered vaccination starting next week, Ragnheiður says. Read More: What’s the Status of COVID-19 Vaccination in Iceland? It is standard procedure for all individuals to remain at the vaccination centre for 15 minutes after receiving their dose. This allows healthcare staff to monitor them and provide medical care in the rare case they exhibit allergic reactions to the drug. “It was great that the Symphony Orchestra contacted us and asked whether they could come and play for people, because everyone has to wait 15 minutes until they can leave,” Ragnheiður explained. A little bit of music should certainly help soothe nerves and pass the time for today’s vaccine recipients.

299,Iceland Review,MAST Reviewing Footage of Mistreated Mares in Youtube Doc,2021/11/23,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority is currently reviewing footage from a Youtube documentary that features clips of Icelandic mares being mistreated during blood-collection procedures. The conditions and conduct caught on camera are “utterly unacceptable,” says the Chairman of the Horse Breeders Association of Iceland. On November 19, Tierschutzbund Zürich (TSB, Switzerland) and the Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF, Germany) posted a documentary to Youtube under the heading “Iceland – Land of the 5,000 Blood Mares.” The documentary reports on the activities within so-called “blood farms” in Iceland, where blood is drawn from mares in early pregnancy to extract ECG (previously known as pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin or PMSG): a hormone commonly used in concert with progestogens to induce ovulation in livestock prior to artificial insemination. The documentary features footage from hidden cameras showing workers beating and shouting at horses. The filmmakers claim to have discovered “widespread animal-welfare violations” in Iceland, which run counter to claims made by pharmaceutical companies on the nature of blood-collection procedures in the country. As noted by MAST, the extraction of ECG from pregnant mares is a growing industry in Iceland; blood from almost 5,400 mares, on 119 farms, has been drawn in 2021. Following coverage of the documentary in the media, various parties connected to blood-collection farms in Iceland have commented publicly. In a press release on Sunday, Ísteka – which manufactures pharmaceuticals from the blood of mares – denounced the treatment of the animals in the documentary: “Ísteka disapproves strongly of sourcing practices that do not comply with the high animal welfare standards we work by and that we recommend to our customers and colleagues. We have immediately started an internal supplier review to investigate the allegations and cannot comment any further on this at this time.” In an interview with Vísir, farmer Sæunn Þórarinsdóttir criticized the footage recorded on her property on the grounds that it lacked context. “None of my operations have anything to do with what is seen in that video,” she stated.  Sæunn further alleged that the documentarians misrepresented reality on several occasions. (Early on in the video, for example, the documentarians say that they’re being followed by a veterinarian driving a grey jeep. “The veterinarian in question was simply on his way home,” Sæunn told Vísir.) “The footage is horrible to watch and not at all an accurate depiction of our operations. We have a complete ban on violence; I would personally beat anyone who laid a finger on my horses,” Sæunn remarked. In a public statement released yesterday, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) announced that it was reviewing the footage seen in the documentary. “The procedures caught on film appear to violate operational conditions, which stipulate the horses’ welfare be ensured.” In the statement, MAST stressed that the supervision of blood-collection procedures is a priority. “Since the regulation on the welfare of horses came into effect in 2014, MAST has established clear conditions for blood-extraction procedures performed on pregnant mares, and we have gradually ramped up supervision.” According to the statement, MAST inspectors pay annual visits to a fifth of blood-collecting farms in Iceland during the time that procedures are being performed. “If, during inspections, serious deviations from protocol are noted, operations are stopped; the operations of five facilities has been halted since 2014.” In an interview with the radio station Rás 2 this morning, Sveinn Steinarsson, Chairman of the Horse Breeders Association of Iceland, stated that it was clear that the horses in the video had been mistreated: blood-collection is a sensitive procedure that demands great care. “The extraction of blood from pregnant mares has been practiced for almost 40 years and the fact that the operating conditions are, after all this time – and given especially how extensive these operations have become – so unsatisfactory is utterly unacceptable,” Sveinn remarked in the interview. While he condemned the mistreatment of mares in the documentary, Sveinn warned against generalization: “I expect that conditions are acceptable in most places, but, as it stands, our discussion is beginning with the lowest-common denominator.” Sveinn concluded by stating that those who were charged with the supervision of blood-collection procedures in Iceland had many questions to answer. “As far as what is depicted in the documentary, I expect no stone to be left unturned.” This article was updated at 15:17.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
300,Iceland Review,Record Proportion of First-Time Buyers on Capital Area Housing Market,2021/11/22,"The proportion of first-time buyers in the Reykjavík capital area housing market has increased significantly over the past year. First-time buyers are younger than before and purchase smaller properties. The average purchase price of properties in this demographic is around ISK 50 million [$382,000; €338,000]. These figures come from a report published by the Economic Division of Landsbankinn bank today. In the third quarter of 2021, the proportion of all buyers on the property market that were first-time buyers reached a record 33.8%. The average age of first-time buyers has also fallen. It dropped to 29 in the second quarter, its lowest since 2006, rising slightly to 29.2 in the third quarter. The total number of first-time buyers was 983, a decrease from a record 1,354 in the first quarter of this year. Read More: Iceland’s Housing Market As the average age of first-time buyers has dropped, so has the average size of the properties they purchase. The average size of apartments purchased by first-time buyers was 94 square metres [1,011 square feet], around 38 square metres [409 sq ft] smaller than the average of other demographics. The Landsbankinn report concludes by stating that rising prices have not prevented many buyers from entering the property market. Lowered interest rates and construction of new apartments have increased access to housing, according to the report. Now that interest rates are rising again and the Central Bank has tightened mortgage requirements, demand for housing is expected to decrease. While conditions on the market have benefited many middle-class buyers, there are indications that the pandemic recession has had the opposite impact on low-income residents of Iceland.

301,Iceland Review,Iceland’s First Self-Checkout Tool Library Opens in the Kópavogur Library,2021/11/21,"Patrons of the Kópavogur Library are now able to borrow tools and equipment, just like they borrow books and media. This weekend, the Munsafn RVK Tool Library opened Iceland’s first self-checkout tool library, called Hringrásarsafn. According to the press release, the initiative is “based on a Circular Economy approach to consumption, which tackles UN Goal 12.” Patrons will be able to borrow tools and equipment for a biannual or annual fee and “can then take tools/things home for repairs, projects, and hobbies.” Per the Munasafn RVK Tool Library website, six-month memberships cost ISK 7,000 [$54; €42] and full-year memberships ISK 12,000 [$91; €81], but discounted memberships are currently available given that the library extensions are in a launch phase. Items listed in the website inventory undoubtedly vary from that at the much smaller Kópavogur branch, but are indicative of the kinds of things that patrons will likely be able to borrow: tools like a circular saw set, wire strippers, an impact drill set, a car battery charger, and crowbar, as well as protective gear (a hard hat), and more unexpected items like a digital projector, camping equipment, and even a Nintendo system. The Hringrásarsafn in the Kópavogur Library is the only one of its kind at present, but organizers have received a grant from the Ministry of the Environment to open more tool libraries in locations of the Reykjavík City Library in the future. As the press release continues: “With more self-checkout libraries available in the future, members can save money, storage space, and resources which helps the planet and aligns with Iceland’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The launch of Hringrásarsafn also coincides with the European Week of Waste Reduction.

302,Iceland Review,Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate to 2%,2021/11/17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Iceland has decided to raise the Bank’s interest rates by 0.5 percentage points. The Bank’s key interest rate will therefore be 2%. This is the Bank’s fourth interest rate hike since May, indicating a change in direction as the economic forecast has improved. The Central Bank’s key interest rate reached a historic low of 0.75% in November 2020. In comparison, rates in January 2020 stood at 3% and in January 2019 at 4.5%. According to the Bank’s new macroeconomic forecast, GDP growth is expected to measure about 4% in 2021. Better prospects for exports result in an improved outlook for GDP growth compared to projections from last August. GDP growth next year is expected to measure just over 5%. The Central Bank nevertheless states that “significant uncertainty remains, and as before, economic developments will depend on the path the pandemic takes.” Inflation rose to 4.5% in October, according to the Central Bank’s statement, and is expected to continue rising in the coming months but then start to ease. Global price increases, a more rapid rebound in domestic economic activity, and rising wage costs are some of the factors behind the rise.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
303,Iceland Review,"Bónus Lengthens Opening Hours, Gives Mascot Controversial Makeover",2021/11/13,"As of Friday, Bónus will have longer opening hours. Vísir reports that the extension was announced to customers at the same time that the discount grocery chain unveiled that its mascot, the iconic Bónus pig—an off-kilter, droopy-eyed swine that appeared to be recovering from a hard night out—had undergone a makeover. But while the later shopping hours will undoubtedly be welcomed, not all locals are equally enthused about the popular porker’s facelift. Bónus CEO Guðmundur Marteinsson says the chain extended its hours in response to calls from consumers. “This is the complaint we receive most often,” he explained. “But we’re cost-conservative and opening hours are part of the cost. But by keeping the opening hours within reasonable limits—we’re not extending them by much—we believe we can implement this without increasing the cost too much. Prices won’t change because of this adjustment.” Previously, Bónus closed at 6:30 pm. From now on, however, seven Bónus locations will be open until 8:00 pm every day: in the capital area, Smáratorg, Skeifan, Spöngin, Fiskislóð, and Mosfellsbær, as well as Helluhraun in Hafnarfjörður and Langholt in Akureyri. The remaining locations will be open until 7:00 pm. In addition, Bónus will open an hour earlier on Sundays, or 10:00 am. ‘He was always a bit cockeyed’ Remarking on the controversial mascot transformation, Guðmundur said, “We’ve just streamlined him a little—it isn’t that big a change. We took out one or two lines that it’s always looked like we forgot to erase when he was initially designed,” he continued, pointing to a crinkle on the Bónus pig’s nose and an extra line on his back. More dramatic, however, is the adjustment of the pig’s left eye. “He was always a bit cockeyed,” Guðmundur said. “But as I see it, this is part of our evolution.” The brand’s font has also been adjusted, moving from a blocky serif font to a cleaner sans serif. ‘Long live the Bónus pig!’ Change does not always come easy, though, and some locals took to social media to mourn the mascot. “What kind of sick joke is this?” wrote Hrafn Jónsson on Facebook. “You take one of the most iconic pigs of all time and mess with it? […] What kind of personality-less impostor is this?” “Why can’t *anything* be left alone in this country?” tweeted @siggiodds. “What is the point/goal? Take the nuance, the history, and the humor away so you’re left with just an empty, generic shell?” The transformation has also already inspired several memes. “Long live the Bónus pig!” proclaimed Rex Beckett on Facebook, screen-capping the messages she sent directly to the company. “I just wanted to say that I am extremely sad about the decision to change the Bónus Piggy’s look,” she wrote. “He was a delightful little weirdo with such a fun personality and his wonky eye made everyone happy. […] Please let us hang onto our old friend.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

305,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Ramps Up,2021/11/06,"In March of this year, a project called Ramp Up Reykjavík launched with the intention of helping local businesses install wheelchair ramps to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Per an press release on the City of Reykjavík website, the organization not only met its initial goal of installing 100 ramps around the capital four months ahead of schedule, it also has a surplus of funds—ISK 15 million [$115,517; €99,876], to be exact—which will be placed in an Access Fund to assist in funding additional ramp access. Ramp Up Reykjavík is a collaborative venture undertaken by local businesses, labour unions, government ministries, associations, banks, and city officials. It was launched by entrepreneur Haraldur Ingi Þorleifsson after finding himself stuck outside downtown shops and restaurants on numerous occasions. He recalls a recent summer night during which he had to sit outside a shop while his family all went inside because there was only one step at the entrance and it was too tall for his wheelchair to go over. “That wasn’t the first step,” he writes. “I’ve sat outside before and often. I’ve not gone to coffeehouses because of that step. I’ve not met friends out. I’ve not gone downtown on Þorláksmessa with my family. All because of that step.” Haraldur isn’t the only person in his position, he continues, noting that thousands of Icelanders use wheelchairs, and thousands of tourists, too. This is what inspired him to start Ramp Up Reykjavík, soliciting donations to fund 100 ramps to start with. Under the terms of the funding, restaurant owners can be reimbursed for up to 80% of the cost of installing a wheelchair ramp on their premises. “It’s amazing how easy it actually was,” Haraldur says. “All the founding members, planning authorities, restaurants, and shops in the area really pushed the boat out to get the ramps set up and we had a lot of support from the start.” Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson praised the project and said the city was prepared to continue funding for it. Ramp Up Reykjavík will continue to improve access around the capital but is also set to move further afield. Akureyri mayor Ásthildur Sturludóttir said she’d support the project in her town and both Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Minister for Social Affairs and children Ásmundur Einar Daðason said that they’d support the initiative in the countryside, having seen how successful it’s already been in the capital.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
306,Iceland Review,400 Small Businesses Form New Association,2021/11/01,"Around 400 small and medium-sized businesses have registered in a new association that was formed yesterday, RÚV reports. The association, called Atvinnufjelag, will take part in contract negotiations separately from the Confederation of Iceland Enterprise (SA) in order to give a voice to smaller businessses. “Over 99% of associations in Iceland are small and medium-size businesses and independent workers,” stated Arna Þorsteinsdóttir, one of the founders of the new association and co-owner of ad agency Sahara. The new association’s preparatory board says smaller businesses need a bigger seat at the table. “What’s not working with SA is the voting system. The bigger a business is, the more votes you have, the more weight you have. So it’s more likely that bigger businesses call the shots.” The premise of the new association is that each company will have one vote, regardless of its size, setting up a majority rule. Arna says smaller companies have felt they do not have enough of a voice within SA. “Especially during COVID, certain response measures were requested for small and medium-size businesses that did not get support.” The association’s founding statement asserts that Iceland’s taxation system is unequal and should take into account the size and scope of businesses’ operations. The association states it will negotiate contracts on behalf of its members and do so independently from SA. Arna hopes, however, “that there will be an open discussion and talks. We recognise that we are sort of gatecrashers here but we just want to get to the table.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
307,Iceland Review,"Purchase of Icelandic Telecommunications System is Long-Term Investment, Says French Company",2021/10/25,"French fund management company Ardian, which has signed an agreement to buy Icelandic telecommunications company Míla, says the purchase is a long-term investment. Speaking to RÚV reporters, Ardian’s CEO of Infrastructure Investments Daniel Graf von der Schulenburg stated he expects the company to hold onto Míla for decades. Icelandic politicians have expressed concern that selling the telecommunications company abroad could pose a threat to Iceland’s national security. All of Iceland’s homes, businesses, and institutions are serviced by Míla’s nationwide telecommunications infrastructure, which includes copper wire, fibreoptic, and microwave systems. The company is therefore the basis of all telecommunications and electronic communications systems throughout the country. Ardian’s purchase of Míla is the largest foreign investment in Iceland in the past decade. The influx of foreign currency the purchase entails could cause short-term deviations in the exchange rate of the Icelandic króna, the Central Bank has stated. The sale is, however, expected to lead to an appreciation of the króna. Míla has been sold to Ardian for ISK 78 billion ($603 million/€520 million). The French company took over the debts of Míla’s previous owner, Síminn ehf., which will make a profit of ISK 46 billion from the sale. Icelandic pension funds are expected to acquire shares in the company amounting to 20%, with a price tag of ISK 10-12 billion. Von der Schulenburg says negotiations with pension funds are going well. The Icelandic government has set some requirements for Míla’s sale, including that the equipment remains in Icelandic jurisdiction and that authorities are informed of who the real owners of the company are at all times. Opposition MP Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, chairperson of the Reform Party, has criticised these requirements as being too little, too late. VR Union Chairman Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson has harshly criticised the sale, fearing it will lead to price hikes for users. He expressed disappointment that pension funds, who hold a majority in Síminn ehf., did not prevent the sale in the first place. Von der Schulenburg described Iceland as an attractive country to invest in due to its wealth, educated population, and bright future of its economy. “We like that stability and good outlook as a place to invest in,” he stated. According to von der Schulenburg, Míla is an exciting investment opportunity because “there’s still opportunities to improve. He stated that Ardian would place emphasis on extending fibreoptic lines to more sparsely populated areas and continue developing the 5G cellular network. Prices will not rise, according to von der Schulenburg, as Ardian will aim to get more cost-efficient usage out of Míla’s infrastructure. Asked whether Ardian would consider selling the company to Russia or China in the future, von der Schulenburg stated: “No, that is not going to happen. We are a very long-term investor and there’s two reasons for that. One is that almost all of our investors are insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds. The majority of the funds are coming from Europe. And these investors have a very long-term perspective.” Von der Schulenburg added infrastructure investing is long-term in general as it takes time to get a return on your investment. “Most likely you will be seeing us for decades.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
308,Iceland Review,Þorlákshöfn Harbour Now Fifth Busiest in Iceland,2021/10/19,"There was a 23% increase in transport through Þorlákshöfn harbour in Southwest Iceland between 2019 and 2020, according to newly released figures from Statistics Iceland. The ports of Reykjavík, Grundartangi, Straumsvík and Mjóeyri in Reyðarfjörður maintained their positions as the four busiest ports in Iceland in 2020. The rankings are based on tonnes loaded and unloaded at the ports. Local authorities in Þorlákshöfn are planning an ISK 3 billion [$23.3 million; €20 million] expansion of the harbour that would allow it to accommodate ships up to 180 metres long and 30 metres wide. The renovation would take three years to complete but the new harbour would be usable within two years, according to Elliði Vignisson, mayor of Ölfus municipality. By docking in Þorlákshöfn instead of Reykjavík, cargo ships would shorten their journey between Iceland and Europe by up to 24 hours, which would lessen the carbon footprint of transport, Elliði stated. A larger harbour in the town could also prove beneficial for the tourism industry, the mayor argued.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
309,Iceland Review,The Pandemic Has Reshaped Unemployment in Iceland,2021/10/18,"While unemployment in Iceland has dropped to pre-pandemic rates, the lay of the land has changed both on the job market and among those who still remain jobless. Thousands are working on temporary contracts and 44% of workers on the unemployment register have been without work for a year or longer, Kjarninn reports. Iceland’s unemployment rate has dropped to 5% and is equivalent to the rate in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic reached the country. It has more than halved since April of this year, when it measured 10.4%. During the height of the pandemic, Iceland’s government implemented several economic response packages that included partial unemployment benefits for workers on reduced hours as well as financial aid for businesses. Despite the drop in unemployment, two notable changes are apparent in Iceland’s labour market as the country embarks on a path toward economic recovery. Rates of long-term unemployment have more than doubled among those who are out of work; and among those who are working, many are on temporary contracts subsidised by the state treasury. The subsidies that allowed many businesses to rehire laid-off workers are scheduled to end in the coming weeks. These subsidies were heavily utilised by tourism-related businesses, which tend to wind down over the quieter fall and winter seasons. It remains to be seen whether tourism companies have recovered sufficiently to retain employees once government subsidies run out. In February 2020, right before the pandemic broke out in Iceland, there were 9,162 people on the unemployment register. Of those people, 1,893 had been without work for 12 months or more, or 21%. In September 2021, the number of people who had been unemployed for a year or longer had jumped to 4,598, or 44% of all those unemployed. The Directorate of Labour is aware of this shift and its director Unnur Sverrisdóttir stated it would focus on tackling long-term unemployment this winter. As has often been the case in recent years, unemployment rates are highest on the Suðurnes peninsula, in Southwest Iceland. The peninsula’s proximity to the airport has led to a high dependence on tourism as a source of jobs. Foreign citizens are more likely to be unemployed than Icelandic citizens, and research shows that they were hit harder by the pandemic recession in Iceland. Foreign citizens’ rates of unemployment have, however, returned to pre-pandemic figures.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
310,Iceland Review,Bank Subsidiary to Build Wellness Community in Capital Area,2021/10/10,"The capital-area municipality of Garðabær has signed a contract with Arnarland ehf, a subsidiary of Arion Bank, to build a new wellness community, Fréttablaðið reports. The community will “emphasize quality of life, nature, and health-promoting services” and be open to residents who are 50 years and older. Per its website, Arnarland be designed with the United Nation’s sustainable development goals in mind and feature an on-site center for companies that “specialize in healthcare services, development, and innovation.” The pharmaceutical and medical supply concern Ósar, as well as its subsidiaries Icepharma and Parlogis, will be building their future headquarters within the neighborhood. “The companies and the residences will benefit from one another’s presence and increase the health-related services that are available to nearby communities,” remarked Parlogis CEO Hálfdan Gunnarsson. Arnarland, which will be approximately 10 ha [24 acres] in size, will be built on a plot of land that has been owned by Landey, an Arion Bank subsidiary, since 2016. Landey recently changed its name to Arnarland ehf. Arion bank holds a 51% share in the neighborhood. The real estate company Fasteignafélagið Akurey, holds the other 49%. The real estate company is owned by father and son Kristján Jóhannsson and Jóhann Ingi Kristjánsson, who together, own a combined majority, or 64%, in Icepharma and Parlogis. Arnarland ehf CEO Þorgerður Anna Einarsdóttir says the community will fill a real niche in the capital-area housing market. “In our opinion, there’s a real shortage of high quality and spacious apartments for people who want to downsize when their chicks leave the nest.

311,Iceland Review,Arion Bank to Ensure 80% of Staff Salaries During Parental Leave,2021/10/08,"Arion Bank has announced that it will guarantee employees up to 80% of their wages during parental leave. The bank promises to pay employees with salaries upwards of 600,000 ISK per month (€4,015 / $4,643) – which is the salary cap, before taxes, of the Parental-Leave Benefit Fund – an additional benefit so that they can take home close to 80% of their regular wages. In a statement published on the bank’s website on Wednesday, Arion Bank declared that it would henceforth guarantee employees up to 80% of their wages during parental leave. The benefit will be granted in addition to payments from the Parental-Leave Benefit Fund and other compensation negotiated through collective-wage agreements. The statement further encouraged employees to make full use of their right to parental leave. The salaries of bank employees vary. As reported by Kjarninn, the monthly wages of individuals employed as consultants and brokers, including those working for Arion Bank, exceeded ISK 1.7 million (€11,377 / $13,158) last year. According to the bank’s new parental-compensation package, the average Arion broker would earn approximately ISK 1,360,000 (€9,103 / $10,528) during up to six months of parental leave, or ISK 760,000 (€5,087 / $5,882) more than the expected payment from the Parental-Leave Benefit Fund. Employees with salaries of ISK 1 million (€6,693 / $7,740) a month receive an additional ISK 200,000 (€1,339 / $1,547) and employees earning ISK 800,000 (€5,355 / $6,192) receive an additional ISK 40,000 (€268 / $310). The parental-leave package forms a part of Arion Bank’s endeavour toward gender equality. “The average wages of men, whether in Arion Bank or in society at large, exceed those of women,” the statement from the bank reads – “and fathers are less likely to use their parental leaves than mothers.” “Guaranteeing employees 80% of their wages during parental leave, regardless of gender or position,” the statement continues, “makes it easier for them to take time off. In this way, this initiative aims to encourage more fathers to make use of their rights. In the future, this step may prove beneficial in ensuring equality of wages between men and women, on the one hand, and increasing the number of women in managerial positions and other positions, on the other hand. Today, women form 44% of the bank’s management.” The statement ends with a quote from Director Benedikt Gíslason: “We hope to make the bank a more desirable place of employment in the eyes of young and talented people.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
312,Iceland Review,Central Bank Continues Raising Interest Rates,2021/10/06,"A 0.25% to the Central Bank’s key interest rate has now brought it up to 1.5%. The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced the decision to raise the rate in a press release today. The MPC consistently lowered interest rates throughout last year in response to the pandemic recession but now says it expects the domestic economic recovery to continue. The Central Bank’s key interest rate reached a historic low of 0.75% in November last year. In comparison, rates in January 2020 stood at 3% and in January 2019 at 4.5%. This is the Bank’s third interest rate hike since May, indicating a change in direction as the economic forecast has improved. The Central Bank also tightened mortgage regulations at the end of last month, stating that rising real estate prices had “gone hand-in-hand with increased household debt.” The move, which entails instituting a maximum debt-to-service ratio of 35% for borrowers (40% for first-time buyers) is intended to support stability on the housing market. Today’s press release says, however, that housing accounted for “a large share of headline inflation in September.” Although underlying inflation is declining, the bank states “there is cause for concern in that inflation expectations appear to have begun rising again.” The bank states it will apply tools to ensure that inflation eases back to target.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
313,Iceland Review,MFRI Advises Greatly Increased Capelin Catch Quota for 2021-22,2021/10/01,"The Marine and Freshwater Research Institute of Iceland has set its new advice for capelin catch quotas for the 2021/22 season at 904,200 tonnes following this autumn’s research expeditions. This is close to sevenfold last year’s quota and a dramatic shift from 2019 and 2020 when no capelin quota was issued at all. The capelin catch will have a positive impact on the economy, states Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson. The MFRI’s advice is based on the autumn’s acoustic measurements but the final catch quota will be issued early in 2022, following further research expeditions in January-February.  Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson told 200 Mílur that the news creates opportunities for fishing towns around the country and that it’s a positive for Iceland’s economy, which is still recovering from the effects of the global pandemic. “This increase in capelin quota would mean that we see an increase in export revenue and more economic growth next year than expected,” Bjarni stated. According to the most recent acoustic survey, the capelin’s spawning stock biomass is estimated at 1,833,000 tonnes. The harvest control rule (HCR) aims at leaving at least 150,000 tonnes of mature capelin at the time of spawning in March with a 95% probability. The index of immature capelin (age 1 and 2) was the third-highest since 1980. While the autumn’s research expeditions were extensive, weather delays caused less coverage in the southwestern parts of the survey area where immature capelin dominated. There was also limited coverage north of Iceland. The estimate of mature capelin has a higher uncertainty than before but acoustic measurements this winter might clarify this issue. The total landings of the 2020/2021 fishing year amounted to about 128 600 tonnes, which is among the lowest catches since 1980. No capelin was caught in Icelandic waters during summer and autumn 2020. The 2021 winter fishery took place from January until March. Despite relatively low catch, last year’s export value of capelin amounted to 20 billion ISK [$154,500,000, €133,140,000]. If it fetches similar prices this year, the export value could be seven times as much.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

If the trend continues, housing prices will continue to rise in the region. The main reason is a lack of plots, according to the Federation of Icelandic Industries (Samtök Iðnaðarins, or SI). There are currently just under 3,400 apartments being built in the capital area. This is an 18% drop compared to the same time last year, when there were 4,100 apartments under construction.

316,Iceland Review,Icelandic Sheep Fetch Handsome Prices at First-Ever Online Auction,2021/09/09,"Icelandic sheep were auctioned in the UK’s first-ever online auction, Bændablaðið reports. The auction was handled by the Scottish “livestock marketing company” Harrison & Hetherington. Twenty-six animals were auctioned in the two-day auction in early September. The highest-earning sheep was the only ewe on offer, Alfifa, who, according to the auction catalog, “had a single ram in 2020 and twin ewe lambs in 2021.” Alfifa fetched ISK 56,000 [£317; $438; €371]. Also for sale was Bijarni, a Shearling Ram who “[w]as commended by Tim Tyne [author of The Sheep Book for Smallholders, known as ‘the bible for sheepkeepers’] in last years [sic] show despite not being entered in ram class.” Bijarni was commended as being “Gentle natured [with] well spaced horns” and noted to “stand on his feet well.” A gimmer, or female sheep that has been weaned but not sheared, named Not Splodge was also sold, as were whether lambs, and a number of ram and ewe lambs. The average price for ewes was ISK 53,875 [£305; $422; €357]. Rams fetched a lower average price, or ISK39,000 [£134; $185; €156]. The whethers fared a little better, with an average price of ISK 33,000 [£185; $256; €216]. Interest in Icelandic sheep has ‘completely spiralled’ The first Icelandic sheep were imported to the UK in 1979. The Icelandic Sheep Breeders of the British Isles (ISBOBI) was founded nine years later, in 1988. Per Cumberland’s News&Star, in recent years, British breeders have cross-bred Icelandic sheep with “…Blackface and Shetlands with much success; others have had particularly good results crossing with the larger continentals.” “Icelandic rams have come into their own,” the article continues, “producing cross breeds which are considered by members of the breed society to be lighter on the ground than some heavy breeds and producing better quality meat than some smaller breeds.” There are currently around 300 Pedigree Icelandic Sheep in the UK, and the Scottish Farmer reports that they are increasingly in demand, hence auctioneers’ decision to sell them via the more accessible, online platform. “In the past our Icelandic Sheep sales have been held as part of our wider rare breeds sales, and in holding an online sale, the aim is to open the breed up to a broader UK wide audience,” remarked Harrison & Hetherington auctioneer Grant Anderson. “In recent years there has been so much interest in Icelandic Sheep, it has completely spiralled,” added Ruth Stanton, assistant secretary of ISBOBI. “The aim of this auction is to help provide us with a measure as to what is happening as well as a benchmark for the breed.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

The newspaper’s report states that the Central Bank is concerned about foreign ownership and control of card payment systems in Iceland, something that was touched on in a letter to the National Security Council in 2019. The Council has met four times regarding the matter. The Central Bank owns an interbank system that secures transfers from deposit accounts between credit institutions. However, the credit card payment systems used within Iceland are is in the hands of private companies. The country’s three payment card companies have been sold from Icelandic to foreign owners in the last two years. Borgun was sold to the Brazilian company Salt Pay, and Valitor and Korta to the Israeli company Rapyd.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
318,Iceland Review,One-Third of Apartments Selling Above the Asking Price,2021/08/13,"About a third of apartments in the Greater Reykjavík area are selling above the asking price, with the asking price for single-family homes having risen dramatically. The average selling time has fallen by 14 days over a one-year period. According to a report from the Housing and Construction Authority published yesterday, approximately one-third of apartments in the Greater Reykjavík area are selling above the listed price. Similarly, the average selling time is decreasing: roughly 37 days in June of this year, compared to 51 days in June of 2020. The HCA has also observed a similar trend in rural Iceland, where apartments have sold in roughly 62 days compared to 89 days last year. Fewer new apartments are being sold above the listed price when compared to older apartments. In June of this year, 50.8% of old apartments were sold under the marked price, 16.4% were sold at the marked price, and 32.7% were sold above the listed price. 23.8% of new apartments, on the other hand, were sold under the marked price, 61.9% were sold at the marked price, and 14.3% were sold above the asking price. In an interview with Vísir yesterday, Ólafur Sindri Helgason, Chief Economist with the Housing and Construction Authority, stated that, in many instances, prospective buyers have offered many millions of króna above the asking price. “The proportion of buyers that are offering above the asking price has increased and has been increasing,” Ólafur stated. “Assets are selling quickly; the average selling time continues to decrease; and the supply of real-estate on the market is decreasing, with a 60% contraction over a one-year period.” The number of registered purchase agreements in the Greater Reykjavík area has been at a record high, although these numbers have begun to fall below the numbers recorded in 2007. A total of 7,432 purchase agreements were registered during the first half of 2021, compared to a total of 4,915 during the same time last year. (In 2007, there were 6,622 registered purchase agreements.) “But if we look at the first six months of the year, there is still a 50% increase in the number of purchase agreements compared to 2020,” Ólafur stated. Interest in detached, single-family homes has been especially high, which likely owes to historically low interest rates: “The cost of single-family homes has been rising dramatically and has far exceeded the price of real-estate in apartment buildings. We’re talking a 25% increase between July 2020 and July 2021, compared to a 16% increase among apartments. Individuals have also begun to look to rural areas: “Some have begun to look for real-estate on the outskirts of the capital area, given the dramatic rise of single-family homes.” According to the report, housing security is improving among residents and so are household finances. In surveys conducted by the HCA in collaboration with Zenter, the number of respondents who state that they are experiencing housing security totaled 91.9% in May of 2021, as compared to 90.2% in June of last year. As noted by the authors of the report, leaseholders (renters) have seen the biggest change in attitude: In June of 2019, 51% of leaseholders stated that they experienced housing security, compared to 66% this year.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
319,Iceland Review,All Icelandic Egg Farms Free-Range by 2022,2021/07/23,"According to new regulations regarding the welfare of domestic fowl, the use of traditional cages in Icelandic egg farming will no longer be permissible as of December 31, 2021. Bændablaðið reports that egg farmers all over the country are in the process of converting their facilities, with the total expected cost of the conversion coming to ISK 3 billion [$23.8 million; €20.2 million]. “To my knowledge, all egg farmers who intend to continue [egg] production are well into converting their facilities into free-range housing and getting rid of their cages,” remarked Stefán Már Símonarson, the head of the Association of Egg Farmers and CEO of organic egg company Nesbú. “I know two producers who are going to stop [farming] at the end of the year because of their age, but then we also have new farms coming in, like Hranastaðir. There are ten egg producers in Iceland today.” Free-range requirements will necessitate farmers providing considerably larger facilities in order to produce the same number of eggs. This is where the major expense comes in. “Estimated cost of the conversion is around ISK 15,000 [$119; €101] per bird. There are over 200,000 laying hens in the country,” he continued, which is how the ISK 3 billion [$23.8 million; €20.2 million] figure was determined. Farmers have a couple different options as to what kind of free-range arrangement they want to provide for their birds. “The most common set up is a platform system where the birds can move between levels and where the nests are in the middle,” explained Stefán Már. “Another arrangement is a traditional floor system on one level or with just a part of it that’s been elevated.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
320,Iceland Review,Major Rent Decrease for Bjarg Tenants,2021/07/21,"The Bjarg íbúðafélag housing association will be lowering the rent for a number of tenants by as much as ISK 35,000 [$280, €238] a month, RÚV reports. The rent decrease will go into effect on September 1. Established by the Icelandic Confederation of Labour (ASÍ) and the Federation of State and Municipal Employees (BSRB), Bjarg is a not-for-profit foundation that aims to provide affordable, long-term housing for low-income families and tenants. According to new data collected by the Housing and Construction Authority, once the decrease goes into effect, rent paid by Bjarg’s tenants will be 20% cheaper than rent on the general housing market. Bjarg has credited a recent government decision to grant favorable, long-term refinancing on the loans it received from the Housing and Construction Authority. The new lending terms will apply to loans that go toward the construction and purchase of apartments for the social good, such as in the case of a nonprofit like Bjarg. A letter of intent outlining this decision was co-signed by Minister of Social Affairs and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Bjarg CEO Björn Traustason, and Housing and Construction Authority Assistant Director Anna Guðmunda Ingvarsdóttir. Bjarg made its first apartment available two years ago and now rents around 500 units. Björn says that the foundation expects to have as many as 1,000 apartments within a few years. The rent decrease is expected to put pressure on other apartment associations to lower their rents as well, Ásmundur Einar remarked to Vísir. “I’ve no doubt it will. This is the first time that we’ve had lower interest rates passed directly down to tenants. This is what happens with companies like Bjarg, which ensures that all profits go straight to the lessee and not to the landlords.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
321,Iceland Review,Unemployment Among Immigrants Dropped by One Third,2021/07/14,"Unemployment among foreign citizens in Iceland has decreased by one-third over the past two months, RÚV reports. Around 3,300 from the demographic have left the unemployment register so far this year. Foreign residents of Iceland have had higher rates of unemployment than Icelandic nationals throughout the pandemic and have been overrepresented on the unemployment register in recent years. Unemployment among foreign nationals rose rapidly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. At the beginning of 2021, almost 9,000 immigrants were out of work and the number had more than doubled over the past 12 months. In June, however, that number had dropped to 5,700, according to figures from the Directorate of Labour. Gundega Jaunlinina, chairperson of the Youth Association in the Icelandic Confederation of Labour (ASÍ), says it is often more difficult for unemployed foreigners to find work than for Icelanders. “Because people may not be as active in their job search and don’t know exactly where they should look and employers are unfortunately less likely to hire foreign workers,” she stated. While Iceland’s tourism industry has been bouncing back in recent months and hundreds have been hired at workplaces like Keflavík Airport, hotels, and tour companies, Gundega says some foreign workers have also found work abroad, either in their country of origin or somewhere else.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
322,Iceland Review,Iceland Signs Free Trade Agreement with UK,2021/07/09,"Iceland and the UK signed their new free trade agreement in London on Thursday, RÚV reports. Minister of Foreign Affairs Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson says that in finalizing the agreement, Iceland has “secured our interests” with its second-most important trading partner. The deal, which also extends to fellow EFTA member countries Norway and Liechtenstein, was announced last month and replaces the temporary agreement that went into effect after Britain left the EU. “In terms of overall trade volumes,” the BBC reported, “this deal is more significant for Norway and Iceland than it is for the UK,” although importantly for post-Brexit Britain, it does signal that the nation is quickly making new trade deals for itself. The UK government also said that reduced import tariffs on products such as shrimp, prawns, and haddock would “cut costs for UK fish processing, helping to support jobs in Scotland, East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire.” At the time, Guðlaugur Þór hailed the deal as “crucial for both Icelandic companies and consumers,” but those in Iceland’s fishing sector have expressed disappointment with the agreement, believing that little will change for their industry prospects. However, speaking to reporters after signing today, Guðlaugur Þór asserted that “[t]his is not an endpoint. It is, however, gratifying if people are seeing the importance of increasing and strengthening our trade network and increasing our access to foreign markets.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
323,Iceland Review,Capelin Brings in ISK 16.4 Billion,2021/07/06,"In the first 5 months of the year, Iceland exported around 26,000 tonnes of capelin products for ISK 16.4 billion [$132.4 million, €111.9 million]. After a two-year shortage of capelin, the price has risen and the average price per kilo has reached record highs. Capelin is one of the most important fish stocks in Iceland, accounting for around 13% of export earnings: only cod brings in more. About 70% of capelin fished in Icelandic waters is sold to the Asian market, with Japan being the biggest buyer though sales to China are increasing. Stocks of capelin have been volatile, making it difficult to predict or plan fishing seasons. Still, in recent years, most of the world’s capelin catch has been caught off the coast of Iceland. This year it took Icelandic capelin fishing vessels only one month to catch the allotted quota though it was raised several times. Export value of the fish has risen even though export figures for the last season have not been finalised.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
324,Iceland Review,Króna Strengthens as Corona Wanes,2021/07/06,"The Icelandic króna has risen in value against the Euro this summer and in fact has been strengthening against the Euro since the beginning of this year, RÚV reports. At the start of 2021, one euro cost ISK 157, while now it costs ISK 147. According to Daníel Svavarsson, director of Landsbanki’s Economics Department, the foreign exchange market is extremely driven by expectations and the boom at the beginning of the year was largely based on what could be called vaccination optimism. In recent weeks, investments related to the large share offerings of Íslandsbanki and the airline PLAY have also made an impact. “The biggest reason is the success of vaccinations and the fact that the pandemic has been steadily declining, which has increased optimism in the tourism industry,” says Daníel. “In recent weeks, the main forces have been linked to the flow of foreign investors into the stock market.” Asked whether he expects the Central Bank to respond to the increased appreciation of the króna, Daníel says he does not foresee that the bank will fix the exchange rate to a certain value. “On the other hand, the Central Bank has been very active in the market in coming in and evening out fluctuations, whether strengthening or weakening.” Daníel expects the króna to continue appreciating in the near future, though he warns it can always fluctuate in both directions in the short term. “Looking ahead to the next six months, I now rather expect it to be on the strengthening side. Given the current situation and the good performance of the tourism industry, where the resurrection has been faster than people dared to hope, I now rather expect it to continue to be relatively strong.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
325,Iceland Review,PLAY Flies Maiden Voyage Between Reykjavík and London,2021/06/25,"New Icelandic airline PLAY flew its maiden voyage yesterday from Iceland’s Keflavík Airport to London’s Stansted Airport. Around 100 passengers were on the flight, some travelling for the first time since the pandemic began. The company opened a public share offering around the same time yesterday that ends today. PLAY’s CEO Birgir Jónsson says the company aims to make a profit by next year. “This is a huge day,” Birgir told RÚV reporters yesterday. “I don’t think days get any bigger in the history of an airline and in the history of this company, so we are absolutely on cloud nine.” PLAY faces fierce competition the country’s established airline Icelandair and as well from around 30 other airlines that are currently flying to and from Iceland. “It’s a large group, but we are going to demarcate a unique position with our route system and flexibility,” stated Birgir. PLAY currently flies to a handful of key destinations in Europe but plans to expand its route network westward across the Atlantic by next year. Read More: WOW air Applies for Air Operating Licence PLAY was founded in 2019 by former executives of WOW air, after the airline went bankrupt that year. The COVID-19 pandemic broke out shortly afterwards and the company delayed its launch and used the period to raise funds and hire staff. Meanwhile, the company that purchased WOW air’s assets recently applied for an air operating licence, spelling a possible resurrection of the defunct airline. The fledgling airline has not taken its first steps without some controversy. Birgir is currently under investigation by the Directorate of Tax Investigations regarding his capital income during the year 2018. One of the company’s board members, María Rúnarsdóttir, is also under investigation by the Directorate due to a possible tax violation as she did not file income tax in the years 2011 and 2012. The investigations were mentioned in documents regarding the airline’s public share offering. PLAY has been criticised by the Icelandic Confederation of Labour (ASÍ) for writing up contract agreements for its employees without consultation with the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association (FFÍ). FFÍ has sent the company a letter demanding they enter into negotiations with the union on a collective agreement for flight attendants.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
326,Iceland Review,WOW Applies for Air Operating Licence,2021/06/23,"More than two years since Iceland’s WOW air went bankrupt, the company that purchased its assets has applied for an air operating licence from the Icelandic Transport Authority, RÚV reports. Airline management specialist Ögmundur Gíslason, who is working for the new owner of WOW, says there are plans to rebuild the defunct airline. Ögmundur says it will take a few months for the licence application to be processed. Following the bankruptcy of low-cost airline WOW air in March 2019, the company’s assets were purchased by Michelle Roosevelt Edwards, known until last year as Michelle Ballarin. The resurrected airline was originally set to take to the skies in late 2019, but the launch has yet to happen. Edwards is something of an enigma and has made several claims to Icelandic reporters that have not proven true. In November 2020, she gave an interview to an Icelandic television crew at a Virginia mansion she claimed was her home. The Washington Post reported last week that she did not in fact own the property and accessed it without the knowledge of its true owner. In the interview, Edwards also claimed other parties owned shares in Icelandair on her behalf and there were plans to merge the company with WOW air. The news of WOW air’s resurrection comes during the same week that a different low-cost airline will launch in Iceland. PLAY, founded by former WOW air executives, will fly its inaugural flight tomorrow. Ögmundur stated the success of the company was irrelevant to the fledgling WOW air. “It doesn’t matter if PLAY is successful or not.”","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0

The bank remains 65% in state ownership, with 24% now in the hands of domestic investors and 11% held by foreign investors. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson celebrated the campaign’s success, stating that it reduced state risk and provided funds for upcoming development projects. “It’s gratifying to see the results of Íslandsbanki’s successful offering,” Bjarni stated. “High demand and participation from the public is particularly gratifying, and Íslandsbanki will have more shareholders than any companies registered on the Icelandic market. This is not least due to the decision to allow subscriptions for as little as ISK 50,000 [$512/€340] and leave individual subscriptions of up to one million krónur [$8,250/€6,800] intact. The sale is profitable for the treasury and will be useful in the development that lies ahead in the coming months.

329,Iceland Review,Rising Mortgages May Put Some Families in Tight Spot,2021/06/11,"Those who recently signed non-indexed mortgages with variable interest rates may find themselves in a difficult position, according to the Director of the Institute of Economic Studies at the University of Iceland. Monthly payments could increase by tens of thousands of króna as interest rates rise. The Central Bank responds to COVID As reported by RÚV, the Central Bank slashed interest rates to historic lows last year to mitigate the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The cuts resulted in a real-estate boom, with many seeking to take advantage of low rates to secure roomier homes or to refinance. The majority of new mortgages signed during the pandemic have been non-indexed with variable interest rates. Although the payments are initially higher, such loans allow lenders to “own their homes sooner.” But as the economy has recovered, the Central Bank has raised interest rates by 0.25% leading commercial banks to do the same. As economists expect inflation to continue to hover well above target rates – despite a strengthening króna – real-estate prices are expected to rise, along with wages, while unemployment is expected to decrease as the price of raw commodities remains high. The best of times, the worst of times Such trends put pressure on the Central Bank to continue to raise interest rates, which will in turn pressure commercial banks to do the same. This will directly impact the public, especially those who signed non-indexed mortgages with variable interest rates. “This could put them in a difficult position,” Sigurður Jóhannesson, Director of the Institute of Economic Studies at the University of Iceland, stated in an interview with RÚV. “Such caveats had been raised before, that is, that these types of mortgages looked good on paper because of the circumstances last winter, but that those circumstances wouldn’t persist forever. Nonetheless, those who were unprepared, who expected interest rates and inflation to remain low, may be put into a difficult spot.” An increase of ISK 25,000 per month As noted in a recent report from Landsbankinn, a 1% increase in variable interest rates for a non-indexed mortgage of ISK 30 million could result in an ISK 25,000 rise in monthly payments.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
330,Iceland Review,Biggest Drop in Unemployment in Two Decades,2021/06/10,"Unemployment in Iceland dropped from 10.4% to 9.1% between April and May of this year, the largest month-to-month decrease in the country since 1994. The number of people on the unemployment register has decreased by around 2,400 during the same period. The biggest decrease in unemployment was measured in tourism-related sectors, where unemployment decreased between 18 and 20 per cent. Vísir reported first. While tourism showed the most change, unemployment decreased across all sectors between April and May, faster than projected. Minister of Social Affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason expressed his satisfaction with the development, pointing to the government’s employment initiative “Hefjum störf!” that aimed to create at least 7,000 jobs through financial support to both private and public institutions that hired new employees. Around 10,400 jobs are now available through the initiative. Ásmundur Einar added that the goal is to create even more jobs in the coming months in partnership with the business community. According to the Directorate of Labour’s projections, unemployment is expected to fall to 7.3-7.7% in June, which would mean the number of people on the unemployment register would drop from 20,000 in April to 14,000 by the end of this month.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

332,Iceland Review,"Over 1,000 Jobs Added at Keflavík Airport",2021/06/02,"Flights are multiplying at Keflavík International Airport, where most travellers to Iceland enter the country, and over 1,000 jobs have been created at the airport thanks to the increase in activity. The mayor of neighbouring Reykjanesbær says many unemployed residents who used to work at the airport are waiting to get their jobs back. Construction on an expansion of the airport has begun and is expected to create additional jobs until its expected completion in 2024. Icelandair has hired 800 employees, mostly crew and flight service staff, to prepare for the summer season. Fréttablaðið reports that the airline is currently operating around 50 departures per week but expects to be operating around 100 weekly departures by the end of June. Seventeen flights landed at the airport yesterday in total and 12 are scheduled for today, with similar numbers expected in the coming days. Icelandic low-cost airline PLAY, which will launch its first scheduled flight on June 24, has already hired employees and expects staff to number 150 by the end of the summer. Isavia, the national airport and air navigation service provider of Iceland, has added 96 full-time positions since February. Many of the positions are in airport shops or other airport services. Keflavík Airport has been a major employer of residents of Reykjanesbær, located nearby on the Reykjanes peninsula. Unemployment in the town was 24.5% at the start of the year but has dropped to 21.6%, double the national rate of 10.6% (for April 2021). The town’s mayor Kjartan Már Kjartansson told RÚV he sees how the increased activity at the airport has made an impact in the town. “Every job makes a difference. There were several thousand people on the unemployment register at the peak earlier this winter and early this spring but now fortunately that group is shrinking and we are very happy with that.” Kjartan adds that not everyone who was working at the airport can expect to be rehired this summer, “but hopefully it will happen in the next two, three, or four years.” Yesterday Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson officially broke ground for the construction of an extension of Leifur Eiríksson Terminal at Keflavík International Airport. The extension will rise to the east of the current terminal building and will measure 20,000 square metres (215,000 square feet). It is expected to be taken into use in 2024.

333,Iceland Review,Unemployment Rates Drop as Tourism Industry Recovers,2021/06/02,"The Directorate of Labour has stripped over 350 people of their unemployment benefits between March and May of this year for turning down job offers without sufficient reason, RÚV reports. Icelandic employers have stated it has been difficult to fill positions, even when hiring from among unemployed people, implying that some unemployed people are not interested in working. Economists state that there are other reasons it’s hard to get people back to work as the pandemic winds down and the economy starts back up again. Complaints from employers in tourism having trouble finding staff have garnered attention, with some implying that individuals receiving unemployment benefits prefer not to work. In April, the general unemployment rate stood at 10.4%, with 20,003 people seeking jobs. Of those, 6,495 had been without employment for more than 12 months. According to the government’s Let’s get to work campaign website, most of the jobs available through the campaign are in accommodation and tourism, government institutions, retail, and the restaurant industry. Almost 8,500 positions are available and already, at least 2,350 have been filled. The number of positions filled could be even higher as it takes a while for a job seeker finding employment to be fully registered within the Directorate of Labour’s system. The Labour Director told RÚV that for the three-month period between March and May, the period of the government’s Let’s get to work campaign, just over 350 job seekers had been stripped of benefits for rejecting job offers without explanation or for not meeting activity requirements. They also stated that a similar number of people had been under investigation but it turned out that in most cases, the job seekers in question had already found work or had other valid reasons for turning down job offers. RÚV also inquired how many times employers had notified the Directorate of job offer rejections but those numbers are not available. The Directorate of Labour encourages employers to notify the Directorate if job seekers turn down jobs without valid explanations. If a job seeker turns down a job without providing a valid explanation, they can lose their benefits for two months. If it happens again, they lose their benefits for three months and if it happens for a third time they lose their right to unemployment benefits altogether. They can reclaim that right after working a full-time job for 24 months. The director of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association Jóhannes Þór Skúlason stated in a Kastljós interview that tourism companies had difficulty hiring people from unemployment lists. Hotel and car rental owners have also stated that they’re having difficulties hiring despite high unemployment rates. The new director of BHM Union Friðrik Jónsson stated yesterday that any such discussions should be based on fact, not conjectures. All talk of unemployment benefits being too high, and unemployed people being the problem, couldn’t be supported with logic or statistics. Strætó, the public transportation company, has stated that they have had no trouble filling empty positions, suggesting that job seekers see tourism as an uncertain industry right now and are looking for jobs they believe are more stable. While employers have complained that it’s hard to get people to work, implying that people are choosing not to work and live off benefits instead, the Landsbankinn economy department has stated that income loss due to unemployment was considerable, even for low-income workers, and that it was unlikely that unemployment benefits kept people from accepting job offers. The more likely reason was that people didn’t have faith that the pandemic was over. The latest economic report by the Landsbankinn economic department states that regular unemployment benefits are around 55% of average income in Iceland, or ISK 307,000 ($2,550/€2,090). The maximum amount of income-linked unemployment benefits is ISK 475,000 ($3,940/€3,240), about 70% of an average income. For people with higher income, benefits they are eligible for constitute an even lower percentage of their salary. The report points out that all over the world, employers are finding it hard to fill positions created by increasing demand as the pandemic winds down. In Iceland, such positions are mostly low-income jobs in the tourism sector. “It is estimated that around 30 million fewer people are employed in the richer part of the world than before the pandemic. Such a situation comes with a lot of waste, not just in lost income but also in declining health, skills, and pride within the workforce. It can’t be ruled out that people’s fear of the pandemic plays a part. If so, we can assume that interest in jobs will increase as more and more people are vaccinated and the pandemic winds down.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
334,Iceland Review,Samherji Issues Partial Apology Amid Media-Targeting Scandal,2021/05/31,"Fishing company Samherji issued a statement yesterday in which the company apologises for the behaviour of its management, which “went too far” in its “harsh” response to negative media coverage, according to the company. Leaked documents show the company’s lawyer, PR consultant, and a ship captain in their employ co-ordinated a campaign targeting journalists who had published investigations into the company’s alleged bribery and tax fraud. While Samherji has set a new tone with the statement, it has left journalists and the public unconvinced. In 2019, a joint investigation by Icelandic media and Al Jazeera into leaked documents from Samherji alleged the company had bribed Namibian government officials to gain access to lucrative fishing grounds off the country’s coast, as well as avoiding taxes by leveraging international loopholes. The investigation made international headlines and led to the resignation and arrest of high-ranking government officials in Namibia. In Focus: The Samherji Scandal Icelandic media outlet Kjarninn published an investigation earlier this month into leaked communications between several Samherji employees who referred to themselves as the company’s “guerrilla division.” The employees worked to gather information on journalists who had published negative press on Samherji as well as trying to discredit them and disqualify them from writing about the company in the future. Several government ministers, including Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, condemned Samherji’s actions after the investigation came to light. Samherji released a short statement yesterday in response to the investigation. It begins by asserting the coverage of the company’s operations over the years to have been “one-sided, unfair, and not always based on facts,” stating that in such situations, it can be “difficult not to react.” It labelled the leaked communications between its “guerrilla division” members as “unfortunate.” The statement concludes with an apology of sorts, stating: “Samherji’s management has also reacted harshly to negative coverage of the company and it is clear that those reactions went too far. For that reason, Samherji would like to apologise for that conduct.” RÚV journalists expressed their hope that the statement signalled a change of direction for Samherji, whose owners have refused to grant journalists an interview since the Fishrot Files scandal broke in 2019. They were, however, critical of its vague wording and lack of reference to specific company executives, actions, or even who the apology is directed towards. “Maybe this apology would have been better if it had been clearer who was apologising to whom and for what,” Heiðar Örn Sigurfinsson, Deputy News Editor of Iceland’s National Broadcaster RÚV wrote in a Facebook post.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
335,Iceland Review,"30,000 New Apartments Needed to Meet Demand",2021/05/28,"An estimated 30,000 new apartments are needed in Iceland over the next decade to meet expected demand. Despite a record number of apartments having been constructed last year, the demand has only increased, according to the Housing and Construction Authority. At the beginning of 2021, the Housing and Construction Authority published a report on housing demand in Iceland. The original report estimated that 3,950 apartments would need to be constructed by the end of the year to maintain stability in the housing market. With the population growing at a quicker rate than previously expected, however, the Authority has updated its report, revising its estimate to 4,450 apartments. In an interview with Vísir, Karlotta Halldórsdóttir – an economics specialist with the Housing and Construction Authority – stated that the demand for housing in Iceland was relatively high. “We are constructing approximately 3,000 apartments annually, which is quite good. However, its speaks to a considerable shortage, the fact that approximately 4,500 apartments are needed this year to meet demand.” Karlotta added that this shortage did not mean homelessness but rather that young adults would be living at home with their parents for longer, or that more individuals would be residing in non-residential buildings or unauthorised housing. According to Karlotta, contractors have complained of a shortage of building sites, which municipalities must provide. “A shortage of plots is inhibitory to the construction of apartments. It appears as if contractors are capable of building more but that the paucity of land makes it difficult.” A record number of new apartments were constructed last year, approximately 3,800. “In reality, it’s not the pace of construction; it’s just that there is great demand these days,” Karlotta remarked. Despite this increased demand, Karlotta encouraged buyers to remain patient. “I think it’s important for buyers not to rush. More apartments will become available. We’re seeing a rise in prices, which most likely originates with a lack of supply, but buyers should take their time, as opposed to rushing to buy.” Earlier this month, RÚV reported that Landsbankinn’s Department of Economics had predicted a 10.5% increase in real-estate prices in 2021 compared to last year. Þorsteinn Arnalds, Director of the Housing and Construction Authority, stated that this increase was to be attributed to lower interest rates. Þorsteinn added that the pandemic has seen increased demand for larger, single-family homes. “It’s clear that single-family homes, especially larger homes, have seen a rise in prices. Maybe this owes to the increased need for better and roomier housing following social restrictions. I don’t expect this trend to change in the capital area, as we don’t expect the supply of single-family homes to increase in the immediate future; it’s mainly apartment buildings that are being constructed.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0

The company has hired a total of 112 new employees over the past weeks and intends on hiring more staff this summer, Víkurfréttir reports. The Blue Lagoon – one of Iceland’s most popular tourist destinations – has been almost entirely closed for business since October 8 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company announced limited opening hours in April and May, but as of Friday, March 28, all of the lagoon’s facilities will re-open. These facilities include the lagoon itself, the Retreat Spa, the Blue Lagoon’s four restaurants and two hotels, along with the company’s skincare shop and research and development centre. According to Víkurfréttir, the Blue Lagoon has recently hired 112 new employees and plans on adding more people to its staff over the summer months. Grímur Sæmundsen, CEO of the Blue Lagoon, has expressed optimism for the summer: “Following an unprecedented winter, it is now more important than ever to take good care of one’s body and soul and to enjoy a pleasant summer.” The government has now fully vaccinated a third of its target population, with two-thirds of Icelanders having received both doses of the vaccine. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason stated that very few vaccinated individuals have been subsequently infected with COVID-19. “Those who have been infected have either just recently received their first or second jab; no one has fell seriously ill.” The health authorities plan on vaccinating approximately 14,000 people next week with vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Jansen. According to government regulations, fully vaccinated travelers need to take a PCR test upon arrival at the international airport. They are then required to self-isolate until they receive their test results (within a 24-hour period). These guidelines are currently in effect until June 15, 2021.","Business,Society,Travel",1,0,0,0,1,0
337,Iceland Review,UK Energy Company Announces Planned Windmill Farm in Icelandic Waters,2021/05/26,"UK company Hecate Independent Power Limited (HIP Atlantic) plans to build wind turbine farms off the coasts of South and East Iceland that would power the UK via sea transmission cables. There are no plans to connect the farms to the Icelandic power grid. The company has yet to contact the Icelandic National Energy Authority, which would need to grant permission for the project. According to a press release from the company, the wind farms would be completed by 2025. “Crucially, the HIP Atlantic HVDC transmission cables will never connect to the Icelandic transmission system: the high availability wind capacity will be solely connected to the United Kingdom, dispatched by National Grid,” the release states. HIP already operates wind farms in the Irish Sea and North Sea. The Icelandic farms would be located in a different meteorological catchment area in order to be able to supply electricity when the company’s other farms are becalmed. The initial Icelandic investment for the first 2,000 MW pilot phase of the project is expected to be £2.9 million ($4 million) in 2021 rising to an additional £144 million ($200 million) through 2025. The company expects the project to created up to 500 new jobs located in southern and eastern Iceland for the pilot phase as well as 15,000 jobs in the UK. The project is carried out by Hecate Wind LLC, a subsidiary of US company Hecate Holdings LLC, a developer of renewable energy projects. HIP is chaired by Sir Tony Baldry, a former British energy minister. There is no precedent of a foreign energy company producing electricity withing Iceland’s economic zone. Jónas Ketilsson, stand-in of the national energy authority, Deputy Director General for Energy, confirmed to Fréttablaðið that the company has yet to contact Iceland’s National Energy Authority, whose permission is required for the project to be realised.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0

339,Iceland Review,PLAY Air’s First Flight Slated For London In June,2021/05/17,"Low-cost airline Play has acquired an Air Operator’s Certificate, one of the final hurdles to start operating aircraft for commercial purposes. First introduced at a press conference in November 2019, the airline’s first flight is now slated for London Stansted Airport in June. The stated goal of Play airline is to “provide a low-cost alternative for consumers travelling to and from Iceland, as well as across the Atlantic, and to become a key player in the Icelandic tourism sector.” The airline is now one step closer as an Air Operators Certificate is a prerequisite for operating aircraft for commercial purposes. The airline’s first aircraft, Air­bus A321 Neo was registered with the Icelandic Transport Authority over the weekend as TF-AEW, mbl.is reports. The new plane is being branded with the Play colours before it will be flown to Iceland, ready to take on its first flight. The plane is the first of three Play has secured with AerCap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company. While the official website still states that tickets will be on sale soon, Play CEO Birgir Jónsson has confirmed that the airline’s first flight will be to London Stansted by the end of June. The other planes are scheduled to arrive in the country in July. He has previously stated that Play’s destinations are to include the largest cities in Europe, London, Copenhagen and Paris, as well as Alicante and Tenerife. They were also open to planning flights to the US before the end of the year. The airline first made headlines for its ambitious goals and bold branding in 2019, shortly after the fall of WOW air. While the airline’s first flight has repeatedly been delayed, CFO Sveinn Ingi Steinþórsson told mbl.is a year after the announcement that the delay was a blessing in disguise and that the effects of the global pandemic were levelling the playing field for new players on the airline market.

340,Iceland Review,Icelandic Travel Association Publishes Road Map to Recovery,2021/05/14,"The Icelandic Travel Industry Association (SAF) has published 11 proposals to accelerate the rebound of the tourism sector. The proposals are directed at the government set to accede this fall, with Parliamentary elections taking place on September 25. An association of Icelandic tourism companies, the Icelandic Travel Industry Association (SAF) aims to promote the common interests of its members and to support the improvement of their services and operations. Looking ahead to the upcoming elections, SAF has published a so-called road map containing 11 proposals on how the government can expedite the revival of the tourism industry, which is the “precondition of society’s economic recovery,” according to the association. In addition to the proposals, SAF has also launched the website vidspyrnan.is, which features a dashboard of indicators, designed to measure the government’s progress in meeting the aforementioned goals. The proposals are geared toward the following aspects of the Icelandic tourism industry: In an interview with RÚV, Jóhannes Þór Skúlason, Director of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association, stated that the road map was the travel industry’s contribution to the call for a quick recovery following a pandemic-induced recession. “We hope to demonstrate, with these proposals, what is required if we are to achieve as quick a recovery as we believe is possible.” When asked if the travel industry requires such “privileges” as called for in the road map – given how quickly the tourism sector seems to be rebounding, with signs of a resurgence already apparent – Jóhannes pushed back against the term: “As regards the section on the operational environment, for example, it’s not only about travel companies – it’s about the economy in its entirety. It’s this idea that although we’re beginning to see a resurgence, such a thing won’t happen on its own.” Jóhannes concluded by saying that every report concerning the recovery of the economy assumes that the travel industry will lead the way, and that a failure to act could prove costly. “The tourism sector is that industry that can best help us accelerate our recovery. This is not to say that the tourism industry should take over the entire economy. Not at all.”  ","Business,Society,Travel",1,0,0,0,1,0
341,Iceland Review,Erupting Volcano For Sale,2021/05/12,"Owners of the land where the currently active Fagradalsfjall eruption site is located have stated that the estate or parts of it are available for the right price. Landowners state they have received interest and offers on the land but Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir claims that new owners limiting public access to the eruption site is “out of the question. The eruption site is situated on the Hraun estate east of Grindavík, which is owned by 20 individuals. After the eruption started, interested buyers have contacted the owners with the intent of buying the land, including the eruption site, Hraun landowners association representative Sigurður Guðjón Gíslason told Stöð 2. “This must be the hottest piece of land in Iceland right now,” he added. Sigurður stated that they had received 2-3 offers but declined to mention the amounts offered for the land. While interested buyers might intend to profit off of tourism centred on the eruption, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, in an interview with RÚV, stated that it’s out of the question that private parties can shut off the public’s access to the eruption site. The government is funding infrastructure construction in the area and a prerequisite for that funding is continued public’s access to the area. Work on tourism facilities at the eruption site has already begun as it’s currently Iceland’s foremost tourist attraction for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. According to numbers from Visit Iceland, people have hiked up to the eruption site approximately 87,000 times since counting began, which was five days after the eruption started. Landowners have participated in that work, taking part in a workgroup that recently issued a report to the Minister of Tourism. The memo described their plans for the area, which include building a kiosk that would sell refreshments and merchandise, improving parking, and issuing operating licenses for tour operators. The authorities will in turn fund infrastructure construction through the Tourist Site Protection Fund. Katrín stated that the government had not discussed making a bid for the land, instead focusing on ensuring that the public has access to the eruption site. “That’s the prerequisite for everything that we’re doing. The government is funding certain infrastructure construction and access, in order for the public to be able to visit the site.” When asked if new owners could limit public access to the eruption site, Katrín firmly stated: “That’s out of the question.” The eruption began March 19 and currently show no sign of stopping and the lava flow has increased lately. ","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
342,Iceland Review,Sky-High Fines for Norwegian Bank that Serviced Samherji,2021/05/03,"Norwegian bank DNB has been reprimanded by Norway’s Financial Supervisory Authority, which criticised it for failing to regulate the transactions of six companies related to Icelandic seafood magnate Samherji. The bank was fined NOK 400 million ($48.2 million/€40 million) this morning for insufficient surveillance of money laundering. Kjarninn reports that the bank will not appeal the fine. One of Iceland’s largest seafood companies, Samherji was the centre of an international scandal in late 2019 when an investigation alleged the company’s officials had bribed the Namibian government to gain access to lucrative fishing grounds. Leaked documents suggested the company had also taken advantage of international loopholes to avoid paying taxes. Most of Samherji’s financial transactions were mediated by DNB, Norway’s largest bank and one-third owned by the country’s Ministry of Trade and Industry. After the Samherji investigation became public, DNB asked the fishing company for documents to clarify their business with the bank and counter allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. The documents provided by Samherji were deemed insufficient to “clear up the issues brought up by the bank,” and DNB subsequently terminated deposit and payment services for several Samherji accounts at the bank. In December 2020, the bank announced it was facing a fine equivalent to ISK 5.7 billion for poor money laundering protection. DNB was also investigated by the Norwegian Economic Crimes Police after the Samherji documents were made public.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
343,Iceland Review,Government Introduces “Hopefully the Last” Economic Measures,2021/04/30,"Several measures to combat the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will be instituted or prolonged in the coming days, the government announced today.  The measures include a 30,000 ISK one-off addition to child care allowance for those who qualify for income-linked childcare allowance, and a repeat of last summer’s Travel Gift voucher, intended to encourage Icelanders to trade with the struggling domestic tourism industry. Furthermore, permissions to withdraw supplementary pension savings will be extended, closure and reopening grants will be extended and requirements for such grants expanded. Pay-back schedules for supportive loans will be rescheduled, long-term unemployed individuals will receive a one-off payment and funding for children and young adult mental health services will be increased. Students will be able to take student loans over the summer and additional student loans will be available for 2021-22 The government’s stated goal is to keep supporting homes and companies in the final stretch of the fight against the pandemic, claiming that “These measures will protect the foundation of society, protect people and companies’ income, and secure a powerful pushback for Iceland’s economy.” The government notes that economic prospects for 2022-26 suggest a speedy economic recovery and that even during the pandemic, purchasing power has increased and domestic demand only contracted by 1.9%, among the smallest contractions in European countries.  Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson told RÚV that he hoped that these economic measures will be the last the government needs to introduce. He added that while these measures were costly, the treasury could support them. “I think this is the last time we need to introduce measures that are tailor-made to the unique conditions created through extensive gathering restrictions. Hopefully, brighter and more open times are ahead.” Bjarni stated that while these measures are expensive, he considered it money well spent. “The cost of not reacting is much higher,” he stated.

346,Iceland Review,Four Fish Farms On Land Planned In Þorlákshöfn,2021/04/28,"Construction on what is to become the country’s largest fish farm on land is begun, a short distance from Þorlákshöfn in southern Iceland, RÚV reports. The fish farm could produce over 20,000 tonnes of salmon per year and create around 150 jobs. Three more companies plan to start fish farming on land in the area, which requires a great deal of energy. Landeldi is owned by six Icelanders, one of whom is Ingólfur Snorrason. He told RÚV that an environmental impact assessment for 6.000-tonne annual production has already been approved but that the company intends to increase their production to 20,000 tonnes before long. He stated that export to the US market was under consideration and that the fish farm could create around 150 jobs in the area. “We’ve started production. We have a spawning centre close to Hveragerði where we have around 800,000 roe and young fish. Let’s call it our first generation.” He added that the fish will have grown large enough to be slaughtered and sold by the end of next year. While fish farming in sea pens has been criticised for its environmental impact, fish farming in tanks on land eliminates many problems such as the possibility of farmed salmon mixing with wild fish and pollution from waste gathering on the ocean floor. Such operations require more energy but Landeldi claims that Iceland’s geothermal energy can keep the production carbon-neutral. This is not the only fish farm on land planned in and around Þorlákshöfn as three other companies intend to start such a business, Fiskifréttir reported earlier this month. Þorlákshöfn Mayor Elliði Vignisson stated that companies like this required a lot of energy and that he believed the government should ensure that energy prices for environmentally friendly food production should be lower. A fish farm on land capable of producing 20,000 tonnes of fish requires around 120-megawatt hours per year.    ",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
347,Iceland Review,Carbfix to build CO2 Mineral Storage Facility in Straumsvík,2021/04/23,"Carbfix has announced plans to build a CO2 Mineral Storage Terminal in Straumsvík in southwest Iceland. The terminal will be equipped to receive large quantities of CO2 transported by ship andinject it into the basaltic bedrock where it turns into stone. The facility will be called Coda Terminal and Carbfix estimates that its construction and operation will create 600 jobs, directly and indirectly. At full scale, the Coda Terminal will provide annual storage amounting to three million tonnes of CO2. Carbfix CEO Edda Sif Pind Aradóttir states that „The Coda Terminal will receive CO2 transported by specifically designed ships operating on sustainable fuel. The transport of CO2 to Iceland is enabled by the low costs associated with onshore mineral storage. The Carbfix technology will then be used to permanently and safely turn CO2 into stone, deep in within the basaltic bedrock. The Terminal will also be able to store CO2 from local industries, as well as CO2 captured directly from the air (DAC).” The Coda Terminal will be constructed in three phases, with a full-scale capacity of three million tonnes of CO2 annually. The preparation phase will begin in 2021 with engineering and permitting processes. Drilling of the first wells will start in 2022, with the aim of commencing operations in 2025 and reaching full scale by 2030. The Carbfix technology is based on dissolving CO2 in water before injecting it deep underground, where it turns into solid minerals in less than two years. It doesn’t require much except water, electricity, CO2 and reactive rock formations such as basalts, and according to Carbfix, the area around Straumsvík is ideal. “The environment in Straumsvík, with its fresh basaltic lavas and vast sources of groundwater streams, is perfectly suited for permanent and safe CO2 mineral storage. The power requirements are minimal, and the transmission grid and an industrial harbour are already in place,” says Edda, adding that the storage capacity is more than sufficient, as Carbfix geologists estimate that Iceland alone could store around 80-200 times the annual global emission of CO2. The name, Coda, comes from music and refers to a concluding passage that brings the musical piece to a satisfactory Read more about the Carbfix program.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0

After the crisis, two leading national dailies were acquired by two major fishing and industrial companies, posing a problem of conflicts of interest.” Read More: Broken News While the statement commends Icelandic legislation, which protects journalists and freedom of expression, it stated that “a lack of funding continues to be the main problem for the media.” Iceland’s government is discussing a new law on funding independent media companies.

The new company held a press conference in November 2019 to present its name and details of its forthcoming operations. One and a half years later, Play has obtained a landing permit at three airports in London and Dublin but has yet to receive an air operator’s certificate, a prerequisite for operating aircraft for commercial purposes. The company aims to list on the First North Growth Market this summer and hopes to raise an additional USD 20 million in funding according to Fréttablaðið’s sources.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
350,Iceland Review,Find No Evidence of Seafood Fraud in Iceland Despite 2016 Study Results,2021/03/22,"Restaurant inspections in Reykjavík have failed to find evidence of seafood fraud indicated by a 2016 study that made international headlines recently, Vísir reports. The study indicated that Icelandic restaurants had some of the highest rates of mislabelled fish in all of Europe. Óskar Ísfeld Sigurðsson, head of food control at the Reykjavík Public Health Authority, says the study results do not reflect food inspectors’ experience. UK media outlet the Guardian published an article last week consolidating 44 studies of seafood products sold in restaurants, markets, and auctions around the world over the past several years. The article stated that of some 9,000 products, nearly 40% were incorrectly labelled. In some cases a cheaper fish was labelled as a more expensive variety, while in others potentially poisonous species were mislabelled, leading to health risk. One of the studies cited was published in 2018 and concerned restaurants across Europe. It found the highest percentage of incorrect labelling in Spain, Iceland, France, and Germany. The Icelandic samples for the study were taken at 22 restaurants in 2016. DNA analysis revealed that 23% of the samples belonged to another species than was advertised and fish had been mislabelled at 40% of restaurants. Jónas Rúnar Viðarsson of Icelandic Food and Biotech Consulting Company Matís was one of the authors of the study. He stated that a comparable inspection has not taken place since. Conducing such studies is expensive and requires special funding. “It is mainly the Public Health Authority in Reykjavík that has some ability to do something, but it also has to monitor a lot of restaurants. These kinds of studies are expensive,” he stated. Óskar Ísfeld Sigurðsson, head of food control at the Reykjavík Public Health Authority, says the organisation has placed great emphasis on tracing the origin of food products in recent years. While they do not carry out DNA testing like that conducted in the 2016 study, they inspect restaurant menus and whether the correspond to raw ingredients in their freezers and fridges. “If we see expensive fish on the menu and some cheaper fish in the fridge, it would arouse our suspicion, but we do not see any examples of this. These results don’t match our experience,” Óskar said about the 2016 study. Óskar says he expressed doubt about the study’s results when it was first published, saying he didn’t believe it painted a realistic picture of the situation. He requested information on which restaurants had been found to falsely label fish, but was denied, as the data was collected for a scientific study and not public health monitoring. According to Óskar, the mislabelling could more likely be attributed to servers incorrectly naming fish on the menu or simply unintentional mistakes. There have even been examples of restaurants selling more expensive species as cheaper species, something no restaurateur would do on purpose.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
351,Iceland Review,Lumpfish Season Starts Next Week Amid Catch Quota Uncertainty,2021/03/19,"The lumpfish fishing season begins Tuesday, March 23, according to new regulations issued by Fisheries Minister Kristján Þór Júlíusson, in all areas except for Breiðafjörður, where it starts May 20. The IMFRI will issue their suggested catch limits on March 31.  The new regulations allow the Directorate of Fisheries to cut the season short for all other regions but Breiðafjörður if they come close to finishing this year’s allotted catch, and it also allows fishermen to collect lumpfish roe but leave the fish itself behind. These measures are aimed at eliminating uncertainty among lumpfish fishermen, who are facing a difficult season as anti-bycatch legislation, difficult market conditions and the possibility of catch quotas threaten the stability of independent fishermen and rural fishing communities. Unlike most fishing in Icelandic waters, lumpfish fishing is controlled by licenses and fishing periods instead of catch quotas. A lumpfish license gives sailors the right to 25 consecutive days of lumpfish fishing in the period between March 23-30 June. In that period, they can fish as much lumpfish as they can, although authorities keep a watchful eye to see their catch doesn’t exceed that recommended by the Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Institute (IMFRI). The sea around Iceland is split into seven fishing zones, one of which begins the season much later than the others. To protect bird- and wildlife in the area, fishermen in inner Breiðafjörður start their season May 20, much later than others. One of the small boat owners’ main reason for continuing the current system is it’s a system that works – usually. Last year, however, Fisheries Minister Kristján Þór cut the lumpfish season short as fishermen in North and East Iceland had such a good season they were nearing the limit of what experts at the IMFRI believe the lumpfish stock can handle. This was a blow to Breiðafjörður fishermen, as the season there starts later to protect bird- and wildlife in the area. Fisheries Minister Kristján Þór has presented a bill in Parliament that would make lumpfish fishing subject to catch quotas, but the bill has seen fierce opposition from The National Association of Small Boat Owners. While the majority of lumpfish license holders support the bill, as it would be a great financial boon for them, the bill would make it harder for independent fishermen to gain access to lumpfish fishing. As it is, lumpfish fishing is one of the few types of fishing you can get into without owning or renting catch quotas, which requires funds. Last year’s catch disparity was one of the main reasons Kristján Þór presented the catch quota bill, which would make it easier to manage lumpfish catch, but at the moment, most signs indicate that the bill won’t pass parliament this year, at least not in time for this year’s lumpfish season. Due to the global pandemic, global lumpfish prices are low. The most valuable part of the lumpfish is its roe, while the fish itself is secondary in terms of monetary value. The lumpfish is mostly exported to China, while lumpfish roe is exported to Europe. The roe is a luxury commodity, so during times of global pandemic when many restaurants are closed, demand in Europe is low. In China, the demand for the fish itself is non-existent. As the price for the fish is hitting rock bottom, this year’s regulation allows fishermen to collect lumpfish roe but leave the fish itself behind out on the ocean, a novelty for lumpfish regulations, which usually require fishermen to land all of their catch. Under such difficult market conditions, it is normal for license holders to hold off on lumpfish fishing and focus on other, more lucrative types of fishing, but as 200 Mílur has reported, the prospect of catch quotas could make lumpfish fishermen afraid to skip this year’s fishing season. If the valuable catch quotas are distributed based on catch history like the bill currently proposed suggests, fishermen want to make sure they get their piece of the lumpfish pie. According to the Federation of Small Boat Owners Chairman Arthur Bogason, fears of inactive license holders rushing to fish for lumpfish are not keeping him up at night. His feeling, based on conversations with small boat owners across the country, is that there’s not a rush towards lumpfish fishing, as one season of fishing would hardly result in enough of a catch history to accrue much catch quota, calculated on the basis of catch history from 2013-2019. The reason the Breiðafjörður fishermen start later than others is to minimise bird and seal bycatch. The amount of bycatch in lumpfish fishing is a problem, one that could possibly threaten the future of lumpfish fishing. According to Arthur, lumpfish fishermen are continuing their efforts this year to minimise bycatch. In addition to harming wildlife, bycatch is a nuisance for fishermen and can damage fishing gear. Last year, the pandemic affected the Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Research Institute’s ability to conduct in-person investigations of bycatch, jeopardising future export to American markets on grounds of the US Marine Mammal Protection act. While lumpfish export to the US isn’t extensive by any means, lumpfish bycatch could affect US export of Cod, a much more lucrative business. The MMPA taking effect was postponed by one year, giving authorities a little more time to find a solution to the problem but minimising bycatch as much as the MMPA requires is still near-impossible, meaning that as lumpfish fishermen head out next March 23, the future is still uncertain.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
352,Iceland Review,Icelandic Sheep and Cattle Farmers Receive ISK 970 Million in Pandemic Support,2021/03/15,"Kristján Þór Júlíusson, Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, has completed the allocation of ISK 970 million ($7.5 million/€6.3 million) in funding to sheep and cattle farmers to meet the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure is part of a 12-point action plan in response to the effect of the pandemic on Icelandic agriculture. Social and travel restrictions have hit Iceland’s sheep and cattle farmers hard, leading to drops in both demand and prices for their products. “It is undisputed that Icelandic farmers have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including in light of the fact that two million tourists didn’t come to Iceland this year. Thus the demand for food products has decreased while at the same time imports have increased according to tariff quotas. It’s domestic food production that takes that hit,” Kristján Þór wrote last December shortly after he proposed the initiative. He pointed out that prices for meat and wool had fallen and waitlists at slaughterhouses had gotten longer. Meat production is particularly vulnerable to rapid market changes as it can take a year to ramp down production. Thus, lamb and beef reserves in Iceland have grown considerably as demand has fallen locally and internationally. The funds have now been approved and allocated: 75% will go to sheep farmers while the remaining 25% will go to cattle farmers. The funding to sheep farmers will be allocated via an additional mutton quality control surcharge as well as for wool production and through a special action plan on sheep breeding. Cattle farmers will be given an additional payment for each calf that was slaughtered in 2020, some 11,000 animals. The funding is part of a broader action plan to support the local agricultural industry in responding to the challenges of the pandemic. Other measures include freezing tariff hikes, changes to tariff quotas, efforts to increase farmers’ opportunities for home production on the farm, and the creation of a new agricultural policy for Iceland.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
353,Iceland Review,Icelandair Unifies Domestic and International Brands,2021/03/10,"As of next week, Icelandair’s domestic and international flights will be merged under the Icelandair brand. The domestic brand Air Iceland Connect will be scrapped and the company’s domestic and international booking systems will be consolidated. Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason hopes the change will increase the number of passengers in domestic flights in Iceland. “We hope that with strong marketing and connection to our route systems in Europe and North America, we will also be able to increase the number of tourists on domestic flights. It would strengthen our key destinations throughout the country and benefit our customers in increased frequency and better service,” Bogi stated. Once the change takes effect next Tuesday, March 16, domestic flights will be visible in the search engine on Icelandair’s website, and customers will be able to combine international and domestic flights in a single booking. Icelandair will continue operating domestic flights to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, Ísafjörður, and the Westman Islands. Air Iceland Connect and Norlandair had previously collaborated on flights to Bíldudalur and Gjögur from Reykjavík and flights to Grímsey, Vopnafjörður, and Þórshöfn from Akureyri. From March 16, these flights will only be available for booking through Norlandair’s website, though an announcement says the two companies will continue working closely together and services will remain unchanged.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0

Visit Iceland helped facilitate the event’s organisation and hopes that it will be good for local tourism.  Athletes are unhappy with the arena closing for practice for several weeks. This will Riot Games’ second in-person competitive event since the pandemic began as last year, the League of Legends Mid-season Invitational was cancelled due to the pandemic. In an interview with the Washington Post, Riot Games representatives state that Iceland’s methods of dealing with the global pandemic were a significant factor in choosing Iceland as the location. Around 400 people will come to Iceland for the tournaments, Visit Iceland states. Contestants and staff will follow infection prevention regulations to the letter and quarantine before the start of the tournament. Contestants will also be tested regularly during the event and there won’t be an in-person audience. The LOL Mid-season Invitational starts on May 6 and the final is May 23. The following day marks the beginning of the Valorant Champions Tour, ending on May 30th.  Visit Iceland and The Icelandic E-Sports Association are happy with the event, hoping that it will bring revenue as well as marketing opportunities for Iceland’s tourism and even be the first of many international e-sports events. Visit Iceland assisted Riot Games in communicating with the city of Reykjavík and other domestic service providers. “it’s clear that this is an immense opportunity to introduce Reykjavík as a destination for foreign tourists.”Not as thrilled are Icelandic athletes working towards the Olympics. In a Facebook post, Olympian javelin thrower Ásdís Hjálmsdóttir Annerud called closing the arena for practices for the duration of the tournament a sign of grave disrespect towards track-and-field athletes. League of Legends is one of the world’s most popular video game and tournaments attract large audiences. Visit Iceland representative Karl Guðmundsson stated that Reykjavík was one of the 15 cities vying for the opportunity of hosting the event.

356,Iceland Review,Icelandic State Acknowledges Fair Trial Violations in Banking Collapse Convictions,2021/03/04,"The Icelandic state has acknowledged that five Icelanders who were sentenced in the aftermath of the 2008 banking collapse did not receive a fair trial. The European Court of Human Rights was set to rule on the five cases this morning but has struck the applications out of its list of cases as a result of friendly settlements reached between the Icelandic state and the defendants. According to a press release from the ECHR, the Icelandic state will pay Sigurjón Þorvaldur Árnason, Ívar Guðjónsson, Sigurþór Charles Guðmundsson, Margrét Guðjónsdóttir and Karl Emil Wernersson €12,000 each in damages and cover any costs incurred. In light of the state’s acknowledgement, the applicants have the possibility of applying to reopen their cases. The cases concern the applicants’ criminal convictions related to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath in Iceland. They were convicted for a variety of financial offences, including abuse of power and negligence of duties related to their high-level positions in the banking industry. The applications were lodged with the European Court of Human Rights on various dates in 2016 to 2018.

357,Iceland Review,Spotify Dominates Icelandic Music Market,2021/03/02,"Overall revenue in Iceland’s music industry increased between 2018 and 2019, for the fourth year in a row. The sale value of sound recordings from distributors increased 18% between those two years, according to newly-published data from Statistics Iceland. Almost 90% of the sale value in 2019 was due to payments to streaming services. Streaming platform Spotify had a 98% share of all streaming of Icelandic music and was responsible for nearly 90% of total music sales. Payments for music streaming are responsible for the increase, while at the same time, the sale of CDs and LPs has decreased year on year over a long period. The total sale value of CDs, LPs and digital files for streaming in 2019 was ISK 802 million ($6.35 million/€5.27 million), of which payments for streaming were ISK 713 million. Despite an increase in the sale value of sound recordings for the last three years, the total sale value in fixed 2019 prices amounted only to half of the sale value in 1999 (see Figure 1 below). For many years, releases and sales of CDs and LPs have been falling fast. The number of released titles on CDs and LPs decreased sevenfold between the years 2006 and 2019, or from 301 titles down to 41 (see figure 2). The decline in sale of units has even been more severe. From the turn of the century, the number of sold copies has declined 17-fold. In 2019, the sale of CDs and LPs was 48,000 copies compared with 868,000 copies in the year 1999 when the number of sold copies was at its highest (see Figure 3). The number of copies sold per capita has fallen from 3.1 in 1999 down to 0.1 in 2019. Fast growth of streaming revenue in the last few years has not fully compensated for the fall in revenue since around the turn of the century. In 2019, the total revenue was some ISK 802 million ($6.35 million/€5.27 million) compared with ISK 1.586 million ($12.55 million/€10.42 million) in 1999, calculated in fixed prices.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0
358,Iceland Review,Keflavík Airport Bus Service Resumes Operations For Arriving Passengers,2021/02/26,"Reykjavík Excursions will resume their Keflavík Airport bus service for arriving passengers from tomorrow, February 27. The bus service was suspended indefinitely in January this year, due to the restricted flight schedule to and from Iceland. In a Reykjavík Excursions notice, CEO Björn Ragnarsson stated that the recent discussion on the importance of public transport to ensure the continued success of border restrictions was the reason for reinstating the bus service. The Icelandic Transport Authority has posted updated guidelines for operating coach services, which now include instructions on how to transport passengers already in quarantine, as is the case for arriving passengers. This includes wearing masks covering the mouth and nose for the whole trip, social distance of two metres when possible, with the two rows behind the bus driver empty, and each bus should only transport passengers arriving on the same flight. The bus is also to be thoroughly disinfected in between journeys and proper ventilation is required. Björn also stated that the decision to resume the bus service was made in cooperation with the authorities and Isavia. All arriving passengers will now be able to take the bus from the airport, stopping in Hafnrfjörður, Garðabær, Kópavogur and in the city centre.

359,Iceland Review,Icelandic Horse Export Increased By 53% Last Year,2021/02/23,"In 2020, 2,320 Icelandic horses were exported from Iceland, an increase of 53% from the previous year. The biggest export markets are Germany, Sweden, and Denmark, but demand from the USA and the UK is growing. According to statistics Iceland, the combined export value of horses from Iceland in 2020 was over 1.5 billion ISK ($11,717,000, €9,644,000), up half a billion ($4,000,000, €2,800,000) from 2019. Export increased to all of Iceland’s major export markets last year. While Germany is still the largest export market for Icelandic horses, export to the US grew by 176 % and export to the UK and Switzerland close to doubled. Germany imported the most horses, (974), far ahead of Sweden (306) and Denmark (271). The US is in fourth place with 141 horses but interest in the Icelandic horse is growing, as only 51 horses were exported to the US in the previous year. Export to Switzerland also grew by 42% and the number of horses exported to Belgium tripled in the past year. There were also some new markets last year, with three Icelandic horses exported to Latvia for the first time. The reason for the growth in export likely thanks to the devaluation of the Icelandic króna, at least in part, and the marketing efforts of Horses of Iceland. Director of Icelandair Cargo’s export division Mikael Tal Grétarsson also told Bændablaðið last year that he believed the pandemic played a part. The devaluation of the Icelandic króna means that prices are affordable but people are also unable to travel and likely to spend their vacation funds on their hobbies at home instead. He also stated that the growth in export was causing some difficulties as Icelandair Cargo only had a limited amount of horse-safe containers for shipping the animals and that they were acquiring new containers to respond to demand. In January, horse export to Belgium was temporarily halted when some horses got injured at the Liège airport due to human error. The matter was quickly resolved and export resumed a few weeks later, following updated import regulations. While horse export is a growing market, horse import is forbidden in Iceland and has been for centuries. As a result, the only horse breed in Iceland is the small but tough Icelandic horse.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
360,Iceland Review,Rio Tinto Iceland Aluminium Smelter Energy Price Negotiations Settled,2021/02/16,"The National Power Company Landsvirkjun and Rio Tinto Iceland have reached an agreement on energy prices for the Straumsvík aluminium smelter, amending the power purchase agreement (PPA) between the two companies dating back to 2010. Rio Tinto Iceland General Manager Rannveig Rist states that the amended contract means the smelter’s closure has been avoided. Rio Tinto Iceland filed a complaint to the Competition Authority in July last year, claiming Landsvirkjun was abusing its position in the energy market. They have now decided to withdraw it.  The company also heralded the closure of the Straumsvík Aluminium smelter, were Landsvirkjun not to comply, and for the past few months, the smelter has not been running at full capacity. “It’s a huge step for us to have a deal that makes ÍSAL a competitive force, avoiding the risk of the factory’s closure,” stated Rannveig Rist, General Manager of Rio Tinto Iceland. The energy prices are confidential but the nature of the agreement’s amendment has been disclosed. Instead of a fully fixed-price based agreement, the base power price has been adjusted and remains in USD and linked to the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). It will also be partially linked to global aluminium prices. Landsvirkjun Director Hörður Arnarson stated, “This will make it easier for the aluminium smelter to adjust to fluctuations in the aluminium market.” As before, the contract specifies the sale of 390 MW or 3.416 GWh a year and expires in 2036. Rio Tinto is Landsvirkjun’s second-largest customer, purchasing around 20% of its energy output. Hörður told RÚV that it is likely that the company’s revenue from the Rio Tinto deal will remain the same. When asked if they were giving the company a covid-19 discount, Hörður replied that they weren’t, although they did last year, a special discount due to the situation in international markets. When asked why the energy prices were confidential, Hörður stated that the contract was an old one and included confidentiality clauses and that the companies needed to come to an agreement on when and how they are made public.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

The violation in question is landing its catch in Iceland before having landed half of its permissible catch in Greenland. 29.53% of Arctic Prime Fisheries is owned by interconnected Icelandic seafood companies Brim and Útgerðarfélag Reykjavíkur. December 17, Greenland’s government warned the company in January that they needed to land at least half of their permissible catch in Greenland before they landing their catch in other countries.

A considerable portion of the world’s supply of bitcoin, or up to 8%, is mined in data centres in Iceland. The Financial Supervisory Authority has no information on and does not supervise cryptocurrency mined in Icelandic data centres. It’s believed that up to 8% of bitcoin is mined in Iceland. Around 60 companies mine bitcoin in Iceland but only the three service providers offering electronic currency trade and digital wallets are required to register with the Financial Supervisory Authority. While cryptocurrency has been lauded as an ultra-secure decentralised mode of payment, it has come under fire for being ill-regulated and wasteful of energy. US authorities have increasingly tried to supervise the use of cryptocurrency as they are thought to be the cornerstone of various illegal operations, including terrorism, drug trade and the distribution of child pornography. Mining cryptocurrency requires a great deal of energy use. Around 5% of Iceland’s energy production is tied in data centres and around 90% of data centre operations centre on cryptocurrency mining. When asked about cryptocurrency supervision, The Central Bank of Iceland’s Financial Supervisory Authority replied that as cryptocurrencies aren’t legal tender or currency in Iceland so they aren’t subject to legislation on payment services or electronic currency. “Cryptocurrency markets don’t require a licence, they are not subject to laws no. 108/2007 on stock exchanges and aren’t subject to Central Bank of Iceland’s Financial Supervisory Authority’s supervision.” Furthermore, the Central Bank does not have any information on the extent of cryptocurrency trade.

In a press release, Samherji states that the charge is not a surprise in light of the accusations Namibian prosecutors have issued based on the assertions of Jóhannes Stefánsson, whistleblower and manager of Samherji’s operations in Namibia until 2016. Namibia’s Prosecutor General published the charges this morning, charging 26 parties, individuals and corporations, with 14 charges such as racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion. Ingvar, Egill Helgi and Aðalsteinn managed or co-managed Samherji’s companies in Namibia. Egill Helgi is charged for his work for Esja Holding and Mermaria Seafood Namibia. Ingvar was financial director for Saga Seafood, Esja Investment and Heinaste Investments. Samherji’s release stated that according to Namibian laws, a charge against a company automatically constitutes charges against its executives. There are 14 charges. Three of them deal with Icelanders, accused of breaking laws on organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. They will need to appear before the Windhoek High Court in Namibia April 22. Samherji’s website states that the charges aren’t a surprise in light of former accusations, which they maintain are based on assertions by Jóhannes Stefánsson. However, Rúv reports that the Fishrot investigation in Namibia is also based on an independent investigation by the Namibian Prosecutor General, which also looked into payments made after Jóhannes left the company, data from Samherji, and payments that passed between companies related to Samherji and the so-called Sharks. Samherji’s statement reads: If a charge will be issued for [Namibian companies connected to Samherji], that will be Samherji’s first chance to defend itself, but such a charge will be fought full force.” The Fishrot Scandal involved Icelandic Seafood Company Samherji’s dealings in Namibia and its alleged bribes and connections to higher-ups in the Namibian government.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

During the two expeditions, the IFMRI estimated that the size of the capelin spawning stock around Iceland is 650,000 tonnes. Earlier expeditions indicated that there was less capelin in Icelandic waters, leading to a smaller catch quota being issued. In the first expedition, three ships searched for capelin January 17-20 giving data for the area south of 65°N but bad weather and sea ice affected the search north of the country. On January 26-30, a total of eight ships covered the area off the Westfjords, as well as north and northeast of Iceland. Together, these two expeditions covered the complete area where capelin spawns. This was not the case in the December and early January expeditions so the previous data gathered does not affect this final counsel. Suggestions for catch quotas are based on that there’s a 95% chance that the spawning stock in March will be over 150,000 tonnes considering predation. According to the latest data, the total suggested catch quotas will be 127,300 tonnes in the winter of 2020/2021 and replaces earlier catch quota suggestions. This is great news for Iceland’s fishing industry as capelin is a valuable fish, according to the Landsbankinn economic analysis. In the years 2012-2018, its export value was second only to Iceland’s most valuable export, cod. Capelin fishing can affect Iceland’s economy greatly, so much so that when smaller capelin quotas than anticipated were issued, Landsbankinn lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2021 from 3.4 to 3.3 %. The largest part of the capelin catch is sold to Norway in the form of fishmeal, and second-largest to Japan, which buys a substantial amount of capelin roe. For two years in a row, no capelin quotas were issued to protect the stock. This hit particularly hard in fishing towns outside the capital area, such as in Vestmannaeyjar islands off Iceland’s south coast. The town holds about a third of the country’s capelin quotas. Mayor Íris Róbertsdóttir told RÚV that she was pleased and happy that capelin fishing was back on the agenda. They would, of course, have preferred to have even larger catch quotas, but were happy that they could resume continuity for capelin markets and keep the trade open. The first capelin caught after the two-year break was landed January 30 in Eskifjörður, when the Greenlandic ship Polar Amaroq brought 700 tonnes of frozen capelin. According to a notice from Síldarvinnslan seafood company, the capelin looked good. There were about 40 fish to the kilo and some krill.  ",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
366,Iceland Review,WOW Buyer Ballarin Claims Indirect Ownership in Icelandair,2021/02/04,"American businesswoman Michelle Ballarin says other parties hold shares in Icelandair on her behalf of which she is the true owner. In 2019, Ballarin purchased Icelandic low-cost airline WOW air’s assets after the company went bankrupt. She told RÚV reporters there were plans to merge the still-defunct airline with Icelandair. Iceland Review reported on WOW air’s bankruptcy in March, 2019, when the company unceremoniously ceased all service, stranding passengers on both sides of the Atlantic and prompting what were then the largest layoffs in Icelandic history. Later that year, Ballarin purchased WOW air’s assets and stated at a Reykjavík press conference that she planned to resurrect the airline. Nearly one and a half years later, WOW air remains defunct, but Ballarin nevertheless appears to have big plans for the brand as well as broader ambitions in Iceland’s aviation industry. Icelandair – the only remaining commercial airline in the nation after the fall of WOW air – experienced its own financial struggles throughout last year as the COVID-19 pandemic brought travel more or less to a halt. The company managed to stay afloat, however, thanks to government support and restructuring its finances, in part through a successful public stock offering last September. In the stock campaign, Icelandair rejected an offer of ISK 7 billion [$274.688 million; €231.961 million] from Ballarin, who would have gained ownership of one-fourth of the company had her offer been accepted. Ballarin now claims, however, that other parties hold shares in the company on her behalf. Ballarin says she plans to purchase more shares in Icelandair and merge the airline with WOW. An interview with Ballarin, where she discusses WOW air and her thoughts about the future of aviation, is featured in investigative journalism program Kveikur tonight.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
367,Iceland Review,Central Bank of Iceland’s Interest Rates to Remain Unchanged,2021/02/03,"The Central Bank of Iceland’s new macroeconomic forecast, published in the February Monetary Bulletin anticipates a growth of 2.5 GDP in 2021, and that the rise in unemployment will stall mid-year, although the forecast and Iceland’s economic prospects are heavily dependant on the success and speed of the pandemic response and vaccination efforts. The bank’s key interest rates will remain steady at 0.75%, at least through March. Domestic demand was more powerful last year than projections expected, and economic contraction less than forecast in November, according to a statement by the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The 2021 outlook for export has deteriorated but inflation is likely to lessen quickly as the year progresses. The Committee has decided to keep the Bank’s interest rates unchanged. The Bank’s key interest rate – the rate on seven-day term deposits – will therefore remain 0.75%, as they have been since November. The rates are at an unprecedented low for Iceland’s Central Bank key interest rates, which stood at 3% January 2020 and 4.5% in January 2019. The Central Bank of Iceland has issued a new macroeconomic forecast, which finds that domestic demand was stronger last year than anticipated last November. According to the Monetary Policy Committee’s statement: “The outlook is for inflation to measure 3.9% in Q1/2021 but then fall relatively quickly over the course of the year, as there is still a sizeable slack in the economy and the króna has appreciated in recent months.” They do warn that “Economic developments will be affected by the path the pandemic takes, however.” The forecast is based on projections that the majority of the public will be vaccinated by mid-2021, both in Iceland and our main trading partner countries, and border restrictions will remain largely similar to what they currently are. While the Central Bank’s forecast can inspire hope, expecting a GDP growth of 2.5 over the course of 2021 and 5.1 next year, registered unemployment has risen this year and was at nearly 11% in December, up by 6.4 percentage points since the previous year. The forecast expects unemployment to start to go down mid-year but nevertheless to remain higher than before the pandemic. Inflation in January rose to 4.3% in January, making it the first month since December 2013 that inflation is higher than the Central Bank’s upper deviation threshold of the inflation target. Despite that, there are indications that inflation will decline rapidly in the near future, as there is a sizeable slack in the economy and inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
368,Iceland Review,Capelin Catch Quotas Raised Three Times,2021/01/26,"Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) has raised its capelin catch quota for the 2020-2021 season, advising that catch should not exceed 61,000 tonnes. MFRI originally issued a catch limit of 21,800 tonnes in December, then raising it to 54,200 tonnes on January 22. The quota was raised a third time on January 24, to 61,000 tonnes, after a mistake in the calculations of capelin stock sizes was discovered. Fishing and processing of capelin is a key pillar of industry in many small communities across Iceland. Iceland’s capelin stock was assessed to be in decline over the last two years, a development experts have linked to rising ocean temperatures. No capelin quota was given out in 2019 after stocks were found to be too low. In South Iceland’s Westman Islands, that decision that impacted 350 employees directly and led to a loss of wages of at least ISK 1 billion ($7.9m/€7.25m). Several other communities in Iceland rely on capelin: in East Iceland, the municipality of Fjarðarbyggð received and processed 47% of Iceland’s capelin catch in 2018. The results of one expedition in December and two in January have given an estimate that mature capelin (those capable of spawning) will exceed 150,000 tonnes in March 2021, taking into account predation. Together, the measurements reduce uncertainty in stock assessments, leading to the MFRI’s current catch quota of 61,000 tonnes.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
369,Iceland Review,Keflavík Airport Bus Service Suspended Indefinitely,2021/01/25,"The Flybus service to and from Keflavík International Airport has been discontinued indefinitely. Reykjavík Excursions, the company that runs the service, announced the decision late last week. Flybus has been the only service operating direct buses between the capital area and Keflavík Airport for at least six months. According to a notice from the company, the Flybus service was discontinued “due to a restricted flight schedule.” Keflavík Airport’s schedule for today shows a total of three flights: two arriving and one departing.  Due to a restricted flight schedule, Flybus will not operate for the time being.
We are sorry for the inconvenience this… Posted by Reykjavik Excursions on Thursday, January 21, 2021 Reykjavík Excursions CEO Björn Ragnarsson told Fréttablaðið the decision will not lead to any layoffs, as drivers will be transferred to Strætó public buses system (RE is a subcontractor of Strætó and operates several bus lines in the capital area). All travellers arriving to Iceland from abroad are required to undergo double testing and a five-day quarantine. To arrive at their quarantine location, travellers may take a taxi, rent a car at the airport and drive themselves, or pick up a car that has been left at the airport for them by a friend or family member. Being picked up by friends or family is considered a breach of quarantine regulations, as is taking the No. 55 public bus through Reykjanes.

370,Iceland Review,Icelandic Seafood Export Bypasses UK Due to Brexit Delays,2021/01/21,"Icelandic seafood exporters have needed to adapt to a changed situation in the UK by shipping seafood to Europe through Rotterdam instead of Immingham, Fiskifréttir newspaper reported today. Hopefully, the changes are temporary. Iceland’s seafood export to the UK is one of the issues still up for discussion in Iceland’s trade deal with the UK, which is still to be finalised. Considerable delays and interruptions have occurred in seafood transport from the UK to countries in the European Union following the Uk’s final exit from the union at the end of last year. Icelandic shipping companies have been affected by delays and have had to adapt to the situation, especially regarding seafood products they have transported to Europe via the UK. Fresh fish has up until now been regularly shipped to Immingham in the UK, loaded on to trucks and driven to France. According to Eimskip representative Björn Einarsson, customers have stopped using the UK as a transit harbour for mainland Europe, due to delays in the Channel Tunnel and tariff issues at the UK-France border. Fresh fish is now shipping directly to Rotterdam instead of going through Europe. “People have adapted their shipping procedures so that the product goes straight to market in Europe through Rotterdam without passing through the UK.” According to Björn, this has not impacted distribution within the UK or export to the UK. Samskip representative Þórunn Inga Ingjaldsdóttir states that it’s too soon to draw conclusions regarding the future only two weeks into the new year. “Delays surrounding Brexit were foreseen.” Exporters have been anticipating this moment for a while now as EU-UK negotiations stretched on. “We’d changed our system a while ago to be able to continue servicing our customers that ship directly to the European markets,” stated Þórunn Inga. She added that Samskip makes it clear that the situation is temporary. “We’ve worked hard to keep up delivery schedules and a high level of service with our customers and friends in the UK.” In an interview with Viðskiptablaðið today, Minister of Foreign Affairs Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson discusses changes to Iceland-UK business relations due to Brexit. While temporary deals with the UK are in place, Guðlaugur notes that despite Brexit finally being a reality, there are still plenty of things to settle regarding trade. As part of the EEA, Iceland is bound in certain ways and until the EU’s Brexit deal was in place, EEA negotiations have been on hold. When it comes to UK-Iceland trade negotiations, seafood is the most important. “If you were to generalise about the UK, they tend to eat fish caught by other nations while exporting the fish caught in their own fishing jurisdiction.” He mentions as an example the quintessentially British dish of fish and chips, which is, by and large, prepared using Icelandic cod. The UK is also Iceland’s largest export market for lamb. Guðlaugur Þór claimed it was important on this occasion to look at the big picture and continue working towards increased cooperation between nations in Europe, stating: “The UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. Cooperation is necessary for more fields than trade.” He added that the EEA states have had no trouble cooperating with the countries of the EU and therefore, there shouldn’t have to be any problems for the UK to continue to work closely with other European countries.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0

372,Iceland Review,Icelandair Implements Regular Drug Testing of All Staff,2021/01/14,"New EU regulations that take effect in February require all airlines flying within the European Union to conduct regular drug tests of flight and security staff. Icelandair will apply this regulation to all staff, including those in administrative positions, starting this month. Ásdís Ýr Pétursdóttir, Icelandair’s Public Relations Officer, told Fréttablaðið the company will emphasise education, prevention, and support alongside the new testing procedures. Under the new EU regulation, certain airline staff working within the union’s member states will be required to undergo regular testing for “psychoactive substances,” defined as “alcohol, opioids, cannabinoids, sedatives and hypnotics, cocaine, other psychostimulants, hallucinogens, and volatile solvents, with the exception of caffeine and tobacco.” The regulations stipulate that in cases of “reasonable suspicion,” alcohol tests may be carried out “at any time.” Flight crew or cabin crew may be suspended from duty if they refuse to co-operate during tests. “As a company in aviation where safety is always a priority, we have decided that this policy will apply to [all staff], but procedures will differ between groups. Icelandair strives to create a safe and healthy workplace and this is one aspect of that, and there will be great emphasis on education, prevention, and support in this project,” Icelandair’s PRO told reporters. Icelandair staff will attend a short workshop later this week where the new regulations will be presented to them. At the end of the month, they will be sent an amendment to their employment contracts concerning the new testing procedures. Iceland’s Parliament has not passed any legislation regarding drug testing of employees. A 2013 opinion from the Data Protection Authority stated there was no legal authorisation for the collection of samples for drug testing from employees of companies or institutions in Iceland. In addition, the Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (Vinnueftirlitið) did not have sufficient legal authority to respond to such cases.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
373,Iceland Review,Icelandic Horse Export Suspended Following Fatal Accident,2021/01/12,"Update Jan 14: Two export companies have reported that export of Icelandic horses to Liège, Belgium will resume on January 20. Icelandair Cargo has stated that while they are still ironing out the details with Liege authorities, that is indeed the case. Export of Icelandic horses to Liège, Belgium has been suspended indefinitely following an accident caused by human error at Liege airport last month. A container with horses fell off a platform, causing severe injury to two horses and minor injuries to a third. The two badly injured horses had to be put down. Bændablaðið reported first. The decision to halt export indefinitely will have a huge impact on Icelandic horse farmers and Icelandic horse enthusiasts in mainland Europe. By far the largest market for Icelandic horses abroad is in Germany, and all horses that are exported to that country go through Liège. Export of Icelandic horses grew by 50% in 2020 as compared to the previous year. Around 2,000 Icelandic horses were exported to new homes abroad last year, and after Germany, their most common destinations were Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Icelandic horses fetch a fine price abroad: one prized stallion set a new record last year when he was sold to a buyer in Denmark, reportedly for tens of millions of krónur, or hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Mikael Tal Grétarsson, Export Manager at Icelandair Cargo, stated that the incident was not due to an equipment malfunction but rather to human error. “We have been transporting horses in specially-equipped containers since 1995 with similar equipment and it has been very successful,” Mikael told Bændablaðið. “We have certain procedures that we follow and our subcontractors should also follow. Then it happens that an employee in Belgium doesn’t follow work procedure, he doesn’t fasten the container sufficiently, so it falls about 50 centimetres from the platform and therefore this accident occurs. This is a human error and we had to put down two horses in consultation with their owners and a veterinarian at the site. One additional horse had minor injuries but did not need to be put down.” According to Mikael, Belgian authorities have now suspended horse imports from Iceland and Icelandair Cargo will be required to adapt their procedure to the country’s recently-updated import regulations. “We need to better understand how we can fulfil them and have, among other things, met with [the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority] here at home to review work procedures. This is a matter of great interest to horse farmers and we take accidents like this very seriously, as we always put safety and welfare in first place.” Read more about the Icelandic horse and its international appeal.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0
374,Iceland Review,Year in Review 2020: Business & Economy,2020/12/30,"This year’s business and economy news undoubtedly centred on the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. Here are Iceland’s biggest business and economy stories of 2020. As everywhere else in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the tourism industry, one of Iceland’s largest industries. Despite some government assistance and a trickle of visitors during the summer, Iceland’s tourism industry has come to a near-complete stop. Locals made up for a portion of the losses by travelling domestically this summer, encouraged by a government gift certificate, but the industry will likely take years to recover. The country’s only commercial passenger airline, Icelandair, also struggled this year, as airlines did the world over. It let go 2,000 employees in April, setting an Icelandic record for the largest mass layoff. Further layoffs followed throughout the year. Icelandair’s contracts with pilots, mechanics, and cabin crew were also up this year and renegotiating them in the shadow of the pandemic was tumultuous, to say the least. The airline even let go all of its cabin crew after their union rejected one contract offer, later being condemned for “union-busting practices.” Thanks to a combination of government support, a successful public stock offering, and other financial restructuring measures, the airline has weathered the storm, at least for the time being. Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason says the company’s position is now strong enough to make through to 2022. Starting in March, the Icelandic government presented several economic response packages intended to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on businesses and individuals. The first package included support for businesses in the form of partial employment benefits for staff whose work hours were reduced, as well as investment in public construction projects. The second package provided additional investments in innovation and research, as well as subsidies for businesses forced to close. These early measures were criticised by some for being geared toward businesses rather than individuals, as well as for leaving out vulnerable groups such as self-employed workers. While some of the measures provided immediate relief, others were mired in red tape and took months to come through. Some funding was geared toward specific struggling industries, such as a new fund to support media companies. These response measures are expected to result in a treasury deficit in 2021. In December, the government announced its intention of selling state-owned Íslandsbanki to finance further social investment. The year 2020 started out with strikes among labour unions, affecting schools and other services in the capital area. Once collective agreements were signed, it seemed that things had calmed down. Yet conflict on the labour market re-emerged in the fall when businesses argued that the economy had suffered so drastically they could no longer provide employees the working conditions outlined in collective agreements. The government eventually stepped in to resolve the dispute, successfully stabilising the labour market. The Central Bank of Iceland did not sit idly by as the recession deepened this year, but implemented measures in support of the economy. The Bank lowered interest rates repeatedly throughout the year to encourage investment, and its key interest rate now sits at a historically low 0.75%. https://www.icelandreview.com/business/icelands-central-bank-lowers-interest-rates-once-more/ The bank’s economic outlook remains highly uncertain, as it stated in November, “economic developments will depend to a considerable degree on the path the pandemic takes.” Not all industries in Iceland have suffered during to the pandemic: as people around the world started looking for ways to pass the time at home, wool export shot up by 70%.  Thanks to Iceland’s success in containing the pandemic locally, and the instituting of strict regulations, Iceland’s film industry was one of the only to keep productions rolling throughout the year. With more people spending their free time at home, it may not come as a surprise that the annual Christmas Book Flood was even more successful than usual, with sales reportedly up by 30%. Real estate sales have also remained strong all year, despite the recession. Finally, one Icelandic company is expanding directly due to the pandemic.

375,Iceland Review,Aim to Sell 25% of State-Owned Íslandsbanki at First,2020/12/23,"The Icelandic government plans to sell 25% of shares in Íslandsbanki bank, which is currently fully state-owned, according to a report published by the Ministry of Finance yesterday. Within a longer timeframe, however, the government aims to sell most or all of its shares in the bank. Reducing state ownership of financial institutions has been an aim of Iceland’s financial policy in recent years and is part of the current coalition’s government agreement. Iceland Review reported yesterday that Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson had approved a proposal from the state holding company ISFI to sell Íslandsbanki. At the time it was not known what percentage of state’s shares would be put up for sale, but the Ministry’s new report states it will be 25%, to begin with. The shares will be sold in a public offering, after which all shares in the bank will be listed on a regulated securities market in Iceland. The sale of Íslandsbanki has been in discussion for some time. The sale is intended to reduce government risk as well as help mitigate the treasury deficit expected next year as a result of the pandemic.

Two of the country’s three largest banks are in state ownership: Íslandsbanki (100%) and Landsbankinn (98.2%). There are no plans to sell Landsbankinn at this point. Iceland’s three largest banks – Íslandsbanki, Landsbankinn, and Arion Bank, were established as state-owned institutions on the ruins of other banks that became insolvent during the 2008 crash. Arion Bank has since passed into private ownership while the other two are state-owned. The Minister of Finance has stated that Íslandsbanki’s value is between ISK 130-140 billion ($1.0-1.1 billion/€834-898 million).

The COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s economic response measures are expected to result in a deficit of around ISK 320 billion ($2.5 billion/€2.1 billion) in 2021. “With the sale, we mitigate the blow of the coronavirus crisis considerably, in addition to which it makes it easier for us to finance continued measures for people and businesses,” stated Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
377,Iceland Review,"As Cemeteries Fill, Reykjavík Residents Choose Cremation",2023/02/05,"With few plots available in Fossvogskirkjugarður and Gufuneskirkjugarður, the two cemeteries in the capital still open to the recently departed, an increasing number of Reykjavíkers are electing to be cremated. RÚV reports that continued construction delays on Úlfarsárdalskirkjugarður, a new cemetery long planned for the east side of Reykjavík, is not expected to be ready for use until 2030. In 2019, Icelandic news outlets projected that Reykjavík residents who died between 2023 and 2025 and wanted to have a coffin burial would have no choice but to be laid to rest in nearby Kópavogur, as all of the plots in Fossvogur and Gufunes Cemeteries would be filled. At the time, it was said that the new cemetery wouldn’t be ready for use until 2025 at the earliest. Projections have now extended that date another five years. See Also: Nondenominational Crematorium and Memory Garden to Open in Cpaital Area (Oct 2021) Thus far, however, no Reykjavíker has had to relocate to Kópavogur in death. Ingvar Stefánsson, Managing Director of Reykjavík Cemeteries, says that this is due to the fact that an increasing number of people are opting for cremations. As such, there are still free grave plots available in Gufuneskirkjugarður. There are still columbarium niches available in both Fossvogur and Gufunes cemeteries. “Gufunes Cemetery was supposed to be fully utilized by now, but will probably be full around 2030,” says Kári Aðalsteinsson, the horticultural director of Reykjavík Cemeteries. “We also have Kópavogur Cemetery and, of course, we have space there, and presumably will until Úlfarsárdalur Cemetery is ready.” ‘A work in progress’ Although current projections slate Úlfarsárdalur Cemetery to be ready for its first burials in 2030, budget cuts announced by the City of Reykjavík may delay the project even further. The cemetery is jointly funded by the municipalities of Reykjavík, Seltjarnarnes, and Kópavogur, but the majority of the cost is to be covered by Reykjavík. Rúnar Gísli Valdimarsson, a civil engineer with the City of Reykjavík, says he believes it will be another three or four years before the park at Úlfarsárdalur is filled in with soil. After that, he says, there will still be a lot of work that needs to be done before the cemetery can be put into use. So he thinks the 2030 projection is accurate. “It’s kind of a work in progress, as one says.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
378,Iceland Review,"‘If we decided it was our goal to reduce food waste, we’d do it’",2023/02/04,"Food waste in Iceland is not only a climate problem, says Minister for the Environment Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, it’s also disrespectful. The Minister says the Icelandic public needs to completely change its attitude towards this serious problem, and more creative solutions need to be considered to deal with it. RÚV reports. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that a third of the world’s food is thrown away. Food waste has long been a major topic of concern in Iceland; the Environment Agency in Iceland has found that 7 out of 10 Icelanders say they want to do their part to reduce food waste. Moreover, reducing food waste is one of the major prongs of the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources’ national policy on waste, which is in effect from 2016-2027. The policy is underpinned by the “ideology of the circular economy, where the priority is to reduce the creation of waste and thereby decrease the demand for finite natural resources.” But although food waste was the first of nine focal points that this policy targeted from 2016-2017, thus far, there’s been little observable change in the actual amount of food wasted in the country over the years.   Guðlaugur Þór says it’s hard to legislate controls or punishments related to food wastage. What’s really needed, therefore, is a complete attitude shift amongst consumers, retailers, and producers—the whole chain must stand together, he says. It’s a matter of public will above all else. “We Icelanders can be very quick to adapt to anything and everything, so if we decided it was our goal to reduce food waste, we’d do it.” The Environment Agency’s website, Together Against Waste, is part of broader awareness-raising campaigns and includes many suggestions for ways in which individuals can do their part to reduce food waste, from taking a picture of what you have in the fridge before you go grocery shopping to cooking from leftovers to “using your nose” to determine if food is still good after its “Best By” date has passed. One creative solution that has been suggested to aid in food waste reduction is to open stores that specifically sell food items that are approaching their “Sell By” dates. However the issue is addressed, addressed it must be, says the minister. “One third of all food [in the world] is thrown away,” concludes Guðlaugur Þór. “We can all see that that’s unacceptable.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Jón is still the most popular, with 5,052 men bearing that name, followed by Sigurður (4,073), Guðmundur (3,838), Gunnar (3,074), and Ólafur/Olav (2,743). Double names have always been popular in Iceland, and Statistics Iceland has also been keeping records on the most common combinations. The most common double names for women are currently: Anna María, Anna Kristín, and Anna Margrét. These haven’t changed since 2018. The top two double names for men have been the same since 2018: Jón Þór and Gunnar Þór. This year, however, there’s been a shake-up with the third most popular double name for men, with Arnar Freyr overtaking Jón Ingi. Anna, Jón not among most popular names for babies born in 2021 Although Jón and Anna may enjoy top ranking when it comes to the most common names overall, they don’t make the cut for babies born in 2021. The top three girls’ names that year were Emilía, Embla, and Sara; the top three boys’ names were Aron, Jökull, and Alexander. Björk and Ósk were the most popular second or middle names for girls; Freyr and Máni were the most popular ones for boys. More common to have a summer or fall birthday than a winter one Unsurprisingly, summer and fall birthdays are more common in Iceland than winter ones (October – March). Just over half of birthdays in Iceland—51.5%—land between April and September. It’s then even more unusual to have a birthday on a major winter holiday in Iceland. As of this year, a total of 1,246 people living in Iceland were born on January 1, New Year’s Day; 780 people have Christmas Day birthdays and 861 were born on Christmas Eve, December 24. A February 29 birthday is uncommon everywhere, and this is true in Iceland, too. Only 234 Icelanders have Leap Year birthdays.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
380,Iceland Review,Budget Constraints Force Sale of Nation’s Only Surveillance Aircraft,2023/02/02,"The operation of the Coast Guard’s surveillance aircraft, TF-SIF, will be discontinued to meet budgetary constraints. The decision marks “a major step back” in the nation’s response and surveillance capacity, the Director General of the Coast Guard noted in a recent press release. The operation of the Coast Guard’s surveillance aircraft, TF-SIF, will be discontinued this year in order to streamline the Coast Guard’s operational costs, a press release from the Coast Guard notes. The Ministry of Justice sent a letter to the Coast Guard earlier this week asking the Coast Guard to prepare the sale process: “The operation of the Coast Guard has proven difficult in recent months due to enormous oil price increases; increased operations, including a larger and more powerful patrol vessel; as well as decreased participation from Frontex (The European Border and Coast Guard Agency) than expected.” In April of last year, Georg Kr. Lárusson, Director General of the Coast Guard, informed the Ministry of Justice that the conditions for Coast Guard’s operational budget “no longer held” owing to the fact that the current budget had not followed more extensive operations and because of increases in the price of oil and other budgetary items. As noted in the press release, funding for the Coast Guard was increased by ISK 600 million ($4.3 million / €3.9 million) in this year’s budget. This increase was expected to prove insufficient, in light of last year’s operating deficit, unless measures were taken that would “compromise the organisation’s statutory roles and response capacity.” Georg Kr. Lárusson observed that the decision to sell TF-SIF represented “a major step back” in the nation’s response and surveillance capacity. “When it became clear that the organisation would not receive further financial contributions, a conversation began with the Ministry of Justice concerning possible ways to get the Coast Guard’s finances back on track. There was no good option in the situation, and we are very disappointed to be forced to stop the operation of the surveillance aircraft, given that it is a specially equipped patrol, rescue, and medical transport plane and an important part of the country’s public safety chain.: “Since 1955, the Coast Guard has operated an aircraft for surveillance and rescue operations along the coast of Iceland. The current decision is, therefore, a major setback in the nation’s response and monitoring capacity. TF-SIF is one of the most important links in the agency’s response chain, and with this difficult decision, a large gap is cut in the Coast Guard’s operations. We also consider the presence of the plane in this country to be an urgent national security issue, especially in light of the changing global political landscape” Georg was quoted as saying.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

Search-and-rescue teams continue to search for Modestas when weather conditions allow. On January 14, nearly 150 search-and-rescue volunteers, alongside the police and the Coast Guard, took part in an extensive search for Borgarnes resident Modestas Antanavicius, aged 46. A helicopter, numerous drones, and fourteen search dogs were employed during the search.

382,Iceland Review,Association of Icelandic Journalists Resigns from the International Federation of Journalists,2023/02/01,"In a statement on their website today, the Association of Icelandic Journalists announced that they would be leaving the International Federation of Journalists. Alongside the Association of Icelandic Journalists (Blaðamannafélag Íslands, or BÍ) were its sister organisations in Norway, Denmark, and Finland. The organisations have repeatedly called for reforms to practices within the organisation. BÍ Chairperson Sigríður Dögg Auðunsdóttir stated: “The reason for the termination is that IFJ has proved unable to make improvements in its operations in accordance with criticism from the Nordic Journalists’ Association and other associations, which has been ongoing for more than ten years. We are dissatisfied with the organisation of elections and the lack of transparency in decision-making.” Central to the recent decision was IFJ’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year. In BÍ’s statement, they cite how regional journalistic associations have been established in occupied areas of Ukraine, and how these associations have been admitted to IFJ and thereby recognised as legitimate. BÍ cites similar instances in contested areas of Georgia as well. Similarly, the choice to host the latest IFJ general assembly in Oman, a nation with strict press censorship, has called into question the association’s commitment to a free press. Sigríður continued: “This is not an easy decision, but we cannot be a member of an international journalistic organisation whose working practices, culture, and decision-making do not meet our demands for transparency and democratic process.” As BÍ’s bylaws require it to be a member to IFJ, the vote needed to be approved by a general meeting. Now, the resignation begins a six-month waiting period. BÍ is expected to leave IFJ by this July. In their statement, BÍ state that they will continue their membership in and cooperation with EFJ, the European Federation of Journalists.  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
383,Iceland Review,A Sticky Decision: Icelandic Competition Authority Debates Whether Guacamole a Sauce,2023/02/01,"Specialists at the Icelandic Competition Authority have been in debates over the nature of several popular condiments, and whether they should be considered “sauces,” following the planned merger of two major mayonnaise manufacturers in Iceland. The Icelandic Competition Authority recently intervened in the acquisition of Gunnars by the Skagafjörður Trading Company, which would see the merger of popular brands E. Finnson, Vogabær, and Gunnars. According to authorities, the merger potentially places the new mayo conglomerate in too dominant a position in the market. Corporate representatives have however disputed this claim, stating that given the difference between their products offered, the new merger would not represent a sauce monopoly. Now, however, the Icelandic Competition Authority is in the sticky situation of defining what exactly constitutes cold, ready-made sauces, and how they differ from other condiments, spreads, and dips. In a statement to Vísir, Páll Gunnar Pálsson, director of the Icelandic Competition Authority, said: “Parties to the merger thought we should include guacamole, BBQ sauce, ketchup and stuff like that to replace the cocktail-mixed sauces. Now we find that we have to define these terms rather closely, and we realize that it sounds rather peculiar. The official report, published on January 26, is some 130 pages long. In its pages can be found subsections detailing at length defining hot sauce, mustard, sour cream, BBQ-sauce and other popular condiments. Páll Gunnar continued: “It’s fair to say that we have actually had serious meeting about whether ketchup can be substituted for cocktail sauce on a hamburger and whether sour cream can be used in place of mayonnaise. This is important for the companies involved, so it’s important to us. And it matters to consumers.”  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
384,Iceland Review,Iceland Maintains 14th Place on Annual Corruption Index,2023/01/31,"Iceland is in 14th place on Transparency International’s Annual Corruption Perceptions Index. The newly-released report measures corruption in 180 countries, with Denmark landing first in this year’s rankings and Somalia in last place. Iceland maintains the same ranking and score it held last year. However, when the last decade is observed, its score has dropped from 82 in 2012 to 74 in 2022. On the scale used by Transparency International, 0 represents “highly corrupt” while 100 represents “very clean.” Transparency International reports that the global average score has remained unchanged for a decade, at just 43 out of 100. “Despite concerted efforts and hard-won gains by some, 155 countries have made no significant progress against corruption or have declined since 2012.” The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is the most widely used global corruption ranking in the world. It measures how corrupt each country’s public sector is perceived to be, according to experts and businesspeople. Each country’s score is a combination of at least 3 data sources drawn from 13 different corruption surveys and assessments. These data sources are collected by a variety of reputable institutions, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
385,Iceland Review,Hotel Workers Vote in Favour of Strike,2023/01/31,"Efling Union members working at seven hotels in the capital area have voted in favour of a strike that will begin on February 7, RÚV reports. Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir stated that 66% had voted in favour of the strike. The Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA) believes the strike is illegal and has plans to file a lawsuit against Efling in the Labour Court. Efling is Iceland’s second-largest workers’ union, with some 20,000 members. Only the workers at the affected hotels were permitted to vote on the strike, just under 300 members. According to Efling, the strike was approved with 124 votes cast in favour and 58 against. Seven voters did not take a stand on the matter. If Efling and SA do not reach an agreement by February 7, an indefinite strike will begin at the following hotels: “We are, of course, proud of our work, but we are also proud of the members who went to the polls and managed to rise up, despite having been subjected to relentless illegal election propaganda, illegal, from the Icelandic Confederation of Enterprise; constant threats and interference from their employers and then of course this unprecedented and illegal mediation proposal by the state mediator,” Sólveig Anna stated. “Nevertheless, these people stood up for themselves and voted to strike in order to push for a better collective agreement.” See Also: Efling Demands Labour Market Minister Intercede in Negotiations Efling is the only union to have not yet finalised a collective agreement with SA in the latest round of negotiations on the Icelandic labour market. The union represents many of Iceland’s lowest-paid workers and has been particularly militant in its recent negotiations, citing the impact of inflation and rising costs of living on workers.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
386,Iceland Review,"With Strike Vote Nearing, Efling Refuses to Hand Over Membership Records",2023/01/30,"In light of Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir’s rejection of state mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson’s proposal, Efling is now being asked to hand over its list of registered members so that a vote on the proposed mediation can take place. As of the time of writing, Efling, Iceland’s second-largest trade union, has refused to comply with the request. Now, state mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson is appealing the matter to the Reykjavík District Court. Following a historically short meeting between Efling and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA), the state mediator suggested applying the terms negotiated between SGS, another major trade union federation, and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise. Sólveig Anna, in her trademark style, rejected the proposal and called into question its legality. Not all agree with this legal interpretation, including former state mediator Ásmundur Stefánsson, who stated to Morgunblaðið: “it is quite clear that the mediator has the authority to submit a mediation proposal and does not need the consent of the disputing parties to do so. That is a fact.” Now, in an attempt to avert a strike, the state mediator seeks to submit the terms of the previous SGS agreement to Efling members. Because of a particularly difficult negotiating climate including rising costs of living, and because Efling represents many of Iceland’s lowest-paid workers, Efling has been particularly militant in its recent negotiations. However, some have pointed out that Efling leadership’s entrenched position may not necessarily represent the general position of its members. Of its some 20,000 members, a few hundred in the Reykjavík hotel sector would be affected by the strike. Members of Efling employed in six Reykjavík hotels are expected to vote on their strike action tonight. If the vote goes through, the strike is expected to begin next week. Update: Efling has since filed an administrative complaint to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour Market regarding the conduct of the state mediator. The Reykjavík District Court has given Efling until this Friday to formally decide whether they will hand over their membership registration to the state mediator.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

389,Iceland Review,Students Express ‘Grave Concern’ Regarding Financial Situation at the University of Iceland,2023/01/29,"In the wake of reports that University of Iceland is facing a deficit of as much as ISK 1 Billion [$7.02 million; €6.46 million] this year, the Student Council (SHÍ) issued a statement on Sunday expressing its “grave concern” about the situation. “It’s clear that the lack of funding has had a serious impact on the school’s basic operations,” reads the statement, and the university council has, as a result, “approved austerity measures that include, among other things, teaching cuts and hiring freezes.” With even further cuts on the horizon for the 2024-25 academic year, the student council fears that the university will be unable to maintain comparable standards to other Nordic universities or adequately prepare its graduates to be competitive on the international labour market. Stated goals not in line with existing funding SHÍ says it has been vocal about its concerns regarding funding at the university on a number of occasions, most recently in its comment on HÍ’s 2023 budget. SHÍ’s president has also “repeatedly raised the issue and the seriousness of the situation with the Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation, as well as the fact that the university budget does not correspond to the priorities or goals that the new Ministry of Higher Education has outlined.” “It defies logic that at the same time calls are being made for an increase in the number of students in the health sciences that the School of Health Sciences has a deficit of ISK 240 million [$1.69 million; €1.55 million] and that goals are being set for increased STEM course offerings while at the same time, the School of Engineering and Natural Sciences has had to significantly reduce teaching due to lack of funding.” ‘The University has fallen in international rankings’ “The University of Iceland plays an important role in Icelandic society and is one of the world’s leading universities,” continues the statement,  “but the fact is that due to a lack of adequate funding for research and teaching, the school has fallen in international rankings,” “Immediate action needs to be taken to foster the foundations of the educational system and strengthen it for the future. SHÍ agrees joins the university council in urging the government to accelerate its review of the university’s operations model such that the funding for public university education is in line with those in comparable countries.” The current state of affairs is contrary to what the government has declared to be its policy regarding higher education in Iceland, says SHÍ, namely that it will “aim for comparable funding of universities in Iceland as is observed in the other Nordic countries.” SHÍ calls for the government to develop an operations model for the university that is not subject to dramatic fluctuation by increasing incentives and fixed funding for universities. “The Student Council demands that the government live up to its constitutional obligation and significantly increase funding for public university education,” concludes the statement. “It is essential to Icelandic society, and will improve standards of living, value creation, and the competitiveness of the educational system, as well as Icelandic society on the international stage.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Denmark, Sweden, and Norway remain the most popular destinations among Icelanders. On Wednesday, January 25, Registers Iceland published data on the number of Icelandic citizens living abroad (as of December 1, 2022). According to the data, 48,951 Icelanders live outside the country, or 13.2% of the total population. This figure has increased by more than five thousand over the period of a single year, Registers Iceland notes. The Nordic countries remain the most popular destination for Icelanders: 62.1% of Icelandic citizens who have a registered legal domicile abroad are registered in the Nordic countries. 11,590 Icelanders currently reside in Denmark (or over 3% of the population), 9,278 in Norway, and 8,933 in Sweden.

391,Iceland Review,A Challenge to Provide Equal Access to Education for Immigrants,2023/01/26,"There are 50 refugee children in Iceland that are not attending school as they are still waiting to receive school placements, including 20 children who have completed the required preparatory process. Minister of Education and Children Ásmundur Einar Daðason said the process to place refugee children in schools has gone well overall considering the level of strain on the system. He added that Icelandic society must do more to ensure all children of foreign origin have equal access to education and job opportunities as native Icelanders. Most of the refugee children who have yet to be placed in schools in Iceland have been waiting since November of last year. “I think that everyone is doing their best to make it happen as fast as possible, but it’s very clear there’s been a lot of strain on our system,” Ásmundur Daði stated. The Minister explained the process in an interview on Rás 2 this morning. “Just to go over it briefly, when a family comes here, it’s the Directorate of Labour that sees to these issues and sends a request to schools, the family has to undergo a medical examination which takes some time, then they will be placed in temporary housing before they receive permanent housing […] that process takes a certain amount of time, and there’s been a lot of strain on the municipalities where this temporary housing is. And it’s been a challenge to get families into permanent housing.” While it would be ideal to place children in school sooner following their arrival, Ásmundur Einar stated that there have been cases where refugee children have moved schools twice within six weeks due to changes from temporary to permanent housing, for example. Such moves are not ideal either, he pointed out. Ásmundur Einar stated it was not only refugee children causing strain on the educational system, but the dramatic increase of children of foreign origin in general. Between 1996 and 2022, the number of children of foreign origin in the school system increased 23 times over, to make up 11% of students today. The Minister says this proportion will only increase and the government is working on ways to improve the reception of children of foreign origin into the school system. Asked about the possibility of setting up special schools for refugee children waiting for permanent placements, Ásmundur Einar stated such a move has been considered. “But it would need to be a holistic decision, not just for children from Ukraine and Venezuela or Syria, but for children of foreign origin. Do we want them to go to a special program to start with where they’re just learning Icelandic for a few months, participating maybe in social activities as well, but not have only children from Ukraine doing that, because we want them to go into the general school system and participate in society here.” The Minister pointed out that the representation of immigrants within Icelandic institutions is not proportional to their numbers within Icelandic society, which is over 15%. “The challenge is how do we help these children to reach the same level of success as the rest of us in Icelandic society. There should be 15 MPs of foreign origin, there should be 2-3 ministers of foreign origin. These people are not getting the same opportunities as the rest of us.” Within the school system, children of foreign origin reportedly achieve lower grades than native Icelandic students, are more likely to drop out and less likely to attend higher education. Children of foreign origin also show less participation in sports and recreational activities. “This is a cause for concern in the long term. We need to think as a society, what can we do differently?” For those who argue that the cost of educating children or teaching them Icelandic is high, the Minister points out that immigrants coming into the system and going straight to the labour market are individuals the country has not had to invest in, in terms of their education.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

393,Iceland Review,Controversial Immigration Bill Back on Parliamentary Agenda,2023/01/25,"After an agreement to shelve further discussion of Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson’s immigration bill until after Christmas, parliament has once again taken up the bill for discussion. Discussions of the bill are expected to last for some time, as the bill has previously been the object of much parliamentary debate. This last fall, the bill was presented and discussed for the fifth time in parliament. The bill aims to shore up what the minister perceives as holes in Iceland’s immigration laws that are open to exploitation. In a statement to Morgunblaðið in October of last year, the minister said: “There are serious concerns within the Schengen area that the refugee system is being abused. In fact, it is more than a concern: we have knowledge of this.” Among other changes, the new legislation would introduce stricter border controls and more restrictions to movement for asylum seekers. The bill has drawn criticism since its inception, and several organisations have called on the government to withdraw the legislation, including many youth organisations throughout Iceland. Several notable advocacy groups in Iceland, including the Red Cross and Amnesty International, have made critical comments about the proposed legislation. Student groups could be seen outside parliament on Monday, January 23, protesting the bill. Now, in the revived debate around the bill, the Pirate Party attempted unsuccessfully to dismiss the bill from the parliamentary agenda. In a statement to RÚV, Pirate Party MP Arndís Anna Kristínardóttir Gunnarsdóttir said: “Considering the situation in our society, we find it unjust that the governing majority here in parliament wants to prioritize this issue. There is a state of emergency in the health care system, in addition to a cost of living crisis, which Icelandic households are feeling.” Much of the debate around the bill revolves around article 8 of the new bill and its suggested changes to the so-called “12-month rule.” Certain loopholes in the bill could, for instance, deny children their right to have their case heard if their parent or guardian violates the conditions of their visa. Critics state that this denies essential rights to children, and fear the bill may be abused in its current form.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

The eruption took place on Heimaey, the largest and only inhabited island of the Westman Islands. Displacing an entire community, it made international headlines at the time, with coverage from the likes of National Geographic and other major publications. In total, some 400 homes were destroyed during the eruption, leading to the evacuation of the island’s 5,300 residents. Despite the extensive damage to property throughout Heimaey, the evacuation was considered quick and effective, with nearly all of the island’s residents evacuated and housed by the end of the day, save a few who remained to carry out essential functions and aid in the salvage efforts. In the days and weeks following the initial eruption, Westman islanders also had to band together to save the harbour. The lava flow from Eldfell threatened to close off the natural harbour, the town’s main source of income and connection to the mainland. With the help of a pump from a dredging boat and a network of pipes throughout the island, seawater was sprayed across the advancing lave in order to slow its advance. The lava-cooling operation, the largest ever of its kind at the time, was largely successful. Despite the extensive damage to homes throughout the island, the harbour was saved. From the initial eruption in January, lava-cooling operations lasted until July. Read more about the 1973 Eldfell eruption here.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0

Jóhannesson was involved in a small adventure when his trip to the Westfjords took a small detour yesterday, January 22. The president was on his way to Patreksfjörður, a small town in the Westfjords, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of an avalanche there that left four residents dead. Following heavy snowfall in January 1983, two avalanches tore off large parts of the hillside surrounding the town, leaving some 30 residents missing, including many children. In total, 19 houses in Patreksförður were damaged, and 500 residents sought refuge in group shelters during the night. The avalanches are one of the most significant events in the town’s history and are commemorated annually. This year, a special 40-year anniversary took place, with a church service, musical performances, and a ceremony that included a candle-lighting and laying of commemorative wreaths. President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson had also planned to be in attendance at the special ceremony. However, as the president stated in a public post on Facebook, “not everything goes according to plan.” On his way to the Westfjords to join in the commemoration, the coast guard ship Freyja, on which he was a passenger, had to make a small detour. The crew of Freyja was tasked with assisting Hrafn Sveinbjarnarson GK, a fishing ship that needed a tow off of Halamið, an important fishing ground off the northwest coast of the Westfjords. After Freyja took the ship in tow, they headed their separate ways: Freyja en route to Akureyri, and Hrafn on its way south. President Guðni added: “It’s no joke to be out on the open sea without light and heat, right by an ice sheet. But luckily it was calm weather, and probably nowhere in Iceland was nicer than out on Halamið today.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
397,Iceland Review,Akureyri Revokes Nighttime Ban on Free-Roaming Cats,2023/01/21,"A controversial law, which would have banned cat owners from allowing their feline friends from freely roaming the town of Akureyri at night has been revoked, RÚV reports. The ban, which would have gone into effect on January 1, 2025, was initially proposed as a total ban on free-roaming cats, but was later ammended so it would only be in effect at night. The majority of the Akureyri town council has now voted to drop the ban all together. The decision will be discussed in more detail at a council meeting later in the week. “The rules aren’t changing at all,” said town council president Heimir Örn Árnason during a radio interview on Friday. “The matter’s been shelved for now.” Cat ban protest party ran for town council last year The planned ban had been extremely controversial since its initial proposal in 2021, with some opponents saying that the town of Akureyri had done nothing to enforce existing laws regarding outdoor cats or suggesting that it would be better to ban outdoor cats during bird nesting season. People also took issue with the law having no grandfather clause that would have allowed current pet cats to live out the rest of their days as free-roaming cats on the prowl. And cats that couldn’t adjust to being indoors full-time risked being abandoned by their owners, argued volunteers at Akureyri’s Kisukot cat shelter. The ban was so controversial that a whole new political party, Kattaframboðið, informally known as ‘The Cat Party’ in English, was formed around the issue. Kattaframboðið ran for Akureyri town council in 2022 with the express purpose of reversing the cat ban. The party did not win any seats, but it did secure 373 votes, or 4.1% of all votes that were cast in the election.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
398,Iceland Review,"Number of Icelandic Residents Nearing 400,000",2023/01/20,"The number of Icelandic residents increased by 2,570 in the fourth quarter of last year, Vísir reports. The increase means that a total of 387,800 people were living in Iceland at the end of 2022.

399,Iceland Review,Public Pools in Capital Area Set to Reopen at 3 PM,2023/01/20,"Following closures yesterday, public pools in the capital area are expected to open again at 3 PM today. Owing to a prolonged cold spell, the utility company Veitur decided yesterday to cut its supply of hot water to some of its largest users, among them, the public swimming pools in the capital area. All of the pools throughout the capital region were subsequently closed. In a news bulletin published yesterday, the City of Reykjavík noted that most of the pools will reopen at 3 PM today. Vesturbæjarlaug, in West Reykjavík, began reheating its hot tubs and pools at noon and hopes that temperatures will be just right at 3 PM. Laugardalslaug will also open at 3 PM. The beach in Nauthólsvík opened again at noon while Árbæjarlaug in East Reykjavík will open at 9 AM tomorrow. Iceland Review recommends calling public pools in advance to make sure that your pool of choice is open. On its website, Veitur noted that – due to the heavy use of hot water – residents in some areas of the capital region may experience a drop in pressure. “We encourage people to take good care of the heat, check the seals on windows and doors, make sure the heating system is working properly and don’t leave the hot tub running on the coldest days,” a post on Veitur’s website reads.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

The precise time of her death remains unknown. Following heavy snow in the capital area during the days leading up to Christmas, Reykjanesbraut – the road leading to Keflavík Airport – became impassable. The closure led to numerous flight delays and cancellations, with many travellers expressing their criticism of the Icelandic authorities.

401,Iceland Review,New Recommendations for Fishing Industry Reform,2023/01/19,"Working groups for “Our Resource,” a policy proposal to reform the Icelandic fishing industry through increased transparency and oversight, have submitted preliminary proposals to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. The submitted proposals are in line with Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Svandís Svavarsdóttir’s decision last May to begin reforming the Icelandic fishing industry from both an environmental and economic perspective. Now, the preliminary results are in. The preliminary proposals, reached in consultation with experts, business partners, and the general population, are numerous, with some 60 proposals requiring further deliberation. A major concern recognised by the new policy proposals is the extent of discarded bycatch produced by the Icelandic fishing industry. Since the beginning of drone monitoring of the Icelandic fishing fleet in 2021, discarded bycatch has been recorded in ca. 40% of fishing boats, according to Heimildin. In order to prevent excessive waste, incentives are needed to ensure that more of the catch comes ashore, while also not encouraging fishermen to catch beyond their quota limits. Current regulations allow for small amounts of bycatch to be brought ashore and sold on the market, with profits split between the fishers and the state. However, the recommendations for “Our Resource” note that often the incentives are not high enough and that large amounts of bycatch are wasted because the cost of bringing it to shore is simply too high. Preliminary recommendations include increasing the proportion of the bycatch profit for the fishermen, which currently sits at 20%, in addition to introducing a standardized and coordinated weighing system. To this day, the Icelandic fishing industry lacks a uniform method of weighing catch. The new proposals also recommend changes for small boat fishermen, who have struggled financially in the last decades to compete with the larger fishing concerns in Iceland: the so-called “Sea Barons,” whose fleets own large portions of the fishing quota. A controversial recommendation includes abolishing the “5.3% system,” in which 5.3% of the total catch quota for different species of fish is reserved for coastal and small boat fishers. This system has been a lifeline for small rural communities, as it guarantees small-time fishermen a minimum amount of catch. However, new policy recommendations would instead place emphasis on other ways of developing rural communities. The 5.3% system has also been identified as a roadblock to technological progress within the industry. Some have critiqued this possible change. Örn Pálsson director of the National Association of Small Boat Owners, stated to RÚV: “I don’t seriously believe that they will carry it through. The 5.3% system was developed in response to some of the mergers that have occurred, and continue to occur, between the largest fishing enterprises in the nation, which have driven many rural fish processors out of business […] There’s no question that things would be harder without the 5.3% system.” The preliminary recommendations for “Our Resource” also include reforms to the gender imbalance within the Icelandic fishing industry. Fishing has historically been a male-dominated industry. To this day, some 10% of Icelandic fishing enterprises employ no women at all, reports Heimildin. However, women have come to increased prominence in middle management, accounting, and executive positions. Proposals would seek to keep the gender balance, legally binding in other sectors of the Icelandic economy, at no more than 60% of male, female or non-binary. Final proposals for “Our Resource” are expected to be presented to parliament by the spring of 2024. The preliminary proposals for the new regulation can be read here.","Business,Nature,Society",1,0,1,0,1,0
402,Iceland Review,Capital Area Pools Closed to Conserve Hot Water,2023/01/19,"Pools throughout the capital region will be closed today due to the cold spell affecting Iceland. Utility company Veitur will be cutting its supply of hot water to some of its largest users, in an attempt to reduce hot water use. In response to Veitur’s reduction, Reykjavík City has made the decision to close the city’s pools today, January 19. The closures will also affect the bathing facilities at Nauthólsvík. The closures will also be in effect in the nearby towns of Mosfellbær and Kópavogur. Bathers will however still be able to visit the pools in Garðabær, though water temperatures may be potentially lower than usual. The Seltjarnes pool will likewise continue to be open, as it is supplied directly from a geothermal borehole. In a public statement, Veitur hopes to not have to limit the hot water supply for any longer than today, as warmer weather is expected. Pools are expected to open tomorrow, but this may be subject to change. The pool closures come during one of the coldest winters in recent memory. This past December was the coldest since 1973, although average temperatures have risen slightly in January. Temperatures have been especially cold in the Reykjavík area, where it has not been colder (on average) since 1916. In light of these unusual conditions, Veitur has also asked residents to help out in conserving hot water where possible. According to Veitur, some 90% of hot water use by Icelandic households goes towards heating alone. Residents are reminded to close doors and windows to conserve energy and to ensure that radiators aren’t blocked from heating the room.","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1
403,Iceland Review,Síminn Retires Clock Service after 86 Years,2023/01/18,"Telecommunications company Síminn has decided to retire their clock service, where residents could call a number to know what time it is, after 86 years of service. The company announced on their website that the service stopped answering calls on January 16. The change comes in response to a world in which information technology has made such services redundant, and Síminn points out in their announcement how we are now surrounded with many devices in our homes and offices that easily provide this service. Utilisation of the service has declined significantly over the decades, and according to Síminn, was barely used at all in its final years. The service was introduced in 1937, when Halldóra Briem was the first voice for the clock. According to Síminn, she travelled to the headquarters of the Swedish phone company Ericsson, where she recorded 90 separate different recordings that could be played back in different versions. During its first years, the service was only available in Reykjavík. It was only introduced to Akureyri in 1950. Over the years, voices of the clock have included actress Sigríður Hagalín (1963), actress Ingibjörg Björnsdóttir (1993), and the first man in 2013 with Ólafur Darri Ólafsson.    ","Sci&Tech,Society",0,0,0,0,1,0
404,Iceland Review,Report Suggests Decreased Fine Collection Leads to Increase in Offenses,2023/01/18,"The Icelandic National Audit Office (INAO) recently published a report on the collection of court fines, stating that since 2014, some ISK 1.3 billion (9.1 million USD, 8.4 million EUR) in court fines have either lapsed or been written off. Now, district attorney Ólafur Þór Hauksson has expressed his concern that this perceived lack of consequences may lead to an increase in offences. In a statement on RÁS 2, Ólafur said: “Of course, we have to think about the deterrent effect of the work we are doing. So we agree with the state auditor that in order for the deterrent to be effective, the punishments must have some consequences.” It came forth in the report that higher fines, in excess of ISK 10 million (70,200 USD, 64,700 EUR) were only collected in around 2% of cases. Notably, the Icelandic National Audit Office published a report with similar findings some 13 years ago and suggested changes to be implemented. Little, however, has been done in the intervening years to reform the problem. The district attorney expressed his fear that the lack of meaningful deterrence could severely undermine law enforcement in Iceland. “We are trying to confront this today, both by securing funding for fine collection, as well as confiscating illegal gains to try to stop this trend,” Ólafur stated to RÁS 2.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

406,Iceland Review,Power Outage Leaves Keflavík International on Backup Power,2023/01/17,"A power outage left all of Suðurnes, the part of the Reykjanes peninsula outside the capital area, without power for some time yesterday. As of the time of writing, power has been restored in all areas. The outage began around 3:00 PM yesterday and power was largely restored by 6:00 PM. For some time during the outage, Keflavík International Airport needed to run on backup power. In a statement to Morgunblaðið, Isavia information officer Guðjón Helgason said that all backup power generators were in operation, and that the operations were not affected. There were no disruptions to the electrical system, but no hot water was available for some time. Guðjón further stated that Keflavík was capable of running on backup power for significant periods of time. Thankfully, the most serious disruption were to handball viewership. After Suðurnes residents expressed their fears that they may miss the South Korea – Iceland match, the local Search and Rescue team “Þorbjörn” stepped in. Grindavík residents were invited to watch the match at the local Search and Rescue station, which has its own backup power generator. Bogi Adolfsson, chairperson of Þorbjörn, stated to Morgunblaðið that about 30 people were in attendance and that it was a “great atmosphere.” Iceland beat South Korea 38 – 25 in the Kristianstad match, Iceland’s last match in the D Group.

407,Iceland Review,"Hafnarfjörður to Pay Childcare Stipends to Parents, Increase Wages for Childminders",2023/01/14,"Parents of children a year and older in the town of Hafnarfjörður may now apply to receive a monthly childcare stipend from the local government, mbl.is reports. These payments are equal to those made to professional childminders, or “day parents,” and are intended to allow parents stay at home with their children longer, therefore bridging the gap between when their parental leave ends, and preschool begins. The town has also approved higher hourly rates for day parents, as well as the establishment of a special fund that will provide grants for day parents who have been municipally employed for at least a year. The Hafnarfjörður town council approved the measures, effective retroactive to January 1, at its recent meeting. In Focus: The Preschool System Day parents are self-employed professionals who are licensed by, and receive work permits from, municipal authorities. These individuals care for children who are either too young to enter preschool, children who are still on the waitlist for a place in the overcrowded pre-k system, and/or children who simply need a smaller, more personalized environment. Licensed day parents generally look after small groups of young children in at-home settings. In its announcement about the new measures, the Hafnarfjörður town council said it believes that new parents need a wider variety of practical solutions for childcare and is looking into such options as extending parental leave and creating more choice within the pre-k and day parent systems. The town, which has a population of just over 29,700 people, currently has just 26 licensed day parents. Day parents ‘an important pillar of childcare system’ Hafnarfjörður appreciates that “day parents are an important pillar of the daycare system,” and the town hopes to recruit more qualified individuals to the profession. Day parents who have worked for Hafnarfjörður for a minimum of 12 months can now apply for a grant of ISK 300,000 [$2,105; €1,944]. Hourly wages for day parents will also increase from ISK 8,433 [$59; €55] to ISK 12,800 [$90; €83] an hour. The council also seeks to better support low-income families and families with multiple young children. Low-income parents can apply for additional subsidies, for one, and ‘sibling discounts’ are available for siblings who go to the same day parent, preschool, or after-school program. The second child receives a 75% discount on fees and the third 100%.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Dr. Valgerður encourages individuals to seek treatment before problems get out of hand. In an interview with Vísir today, Dr. Valgerður Rúnarsdóttir, the Medical Director of SÁÁ (National Centre of Addiction Medicine), stated that many people see the new year as an opportunity to deal with addiction-related issues. About 600 people are currently on a waiting list for treatment at SÁÁ, which is similar to the past few months. Valgerður noted, however, that most people don’t have to wait that long for admission. Valgerður added that many people were hesitant to seek help because they were unsure that their problems were “big enough.” According to Valgerðar, however, the right time to seek help is when the thought occurs that there might be a problem. Read More: In Harm’s Way: Harm Reduction in the Age of Opioids “The most numerous group of people that needs help is precisely that group of people who, because of their addiction, are about to miss out: whether on school, work, or connections with their family. It’s best to intervene while they’re still functional.” Although patients at SÁÁ’s Vogur detox and rehabilitation centre are seeking help for various kinds of addiction-related issues, alcohol abuse remains, by far, the most common. Dr. Valgerður observed that alcohol consumption was “constantly increasing” and that, generally speaking, Icelanders “tend to drink a lot.” “It has huge consequences. Hepatologists, for example, have observed that cirrhosis of the liver has greatly increased in Iceland. And we see that many people are in poor health from heavy alcohol consumption.” Valgerður repeated her point about people not waiting too long to seek help: “I’d like to encourage people, who’ve been considering it for some time, to seize the opportunity now, during the beginning of 2023.

The ICU has not seen as many inpatients since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. There are as many patients at the National University Hospital’s intensive care unit today as there were during the pandemic, RÚV reports. A senior physician told the National Broadcaster that the ICU was headed for a state of an emergency; respiratory infections, such as strep throat (an infection of the upper respiratory tract, caused a bacterium known as Streptococcus pyogenes), have run rampant recently. As of yesterday, 19 patients were staying in the intensive care unit (22 were staying in the ICU at its peak last weekend). There are only fourteen beds. The ICU has not seen such numbers for a long time. “Not since the first wave of COVID-19,” Kári Hreinsson, Manager of Surgery, Anaesthesia, and Intensive Care Services at Landspítalan Hospital, told RÚV yesterday. “It’s been close in the past, with nearly 20 patients in total, but we’ve not exceeded these numbers.” He emphasised that none of this would have been possible were it not for the diligence and hard work of the staff. Kári points out that a state of emergency was declared when 27 people were admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19. He says that it has been discussed whether a state of emergency needs to be declared, but the situation has not yet become that bad. “This is not something that passes in two or three days, this respiratory infection epidemic that has been going on for quite some time and we don’t quite see it coming to an end yet.” A series of serious streptococcal infections, in combination with the other respiratory infections that seem to be spreading throughout society, has added insult to injury. “It makes for a much more dangerous disease and more difficult to treat,” Kári stated. When there are not enough beds, intensive care patients are transferred to the post-surgical care unit (vöknunardeild). When asked if this affected other patients or elective surgeries, Kári stated that this was not the case yet. “But it’s something that could happen in the next few days.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
412,Iceland Review,Westman Islands Celebration Marred by Offensive Effigy,2023/01/09,"Icelandic journalist, podcaster, and athlete Edda Falak has spoken out against recent racist and misogynistic depictions of her at a holiday celebration in the Westman islands. The parade in question was organized by the Westman islands municipal council alongside local sports club ÍBV for Þrettándinn, or 12th Night of Christmas. Postponed in recent years by COVID-19 restrictions, the parade traditionally includes playful troll figures, the holiday bearing many associations with folklore and magic. One troll, however, bore Edda’s misspelled name: Edda Flak. Þetta eru stórhættuleg skilaboð. Það þarf að draga alla sem komu að skipulagi þessa viðburðar til ábyrgðar, svara fyrir hvernig þau ætla að bæta fyrir þetta og laga þessa viðbjóðslegu ofbeldismenningu sem þrífst þarna. Þetta er ekki húmor, þetta er ofbeldi og rasismi. pic.twitter.com/YTgfmsMFbM In the above Twitter post, Edda Falak stated: “This is a very dangerous message. Everyone involved in organizing this event needs to be held accountable and answer for what they plan on doing to fix this disgusting culture of violence that thrives there. This is not humour, this is violence and racism.” Edda Falak was born to a Lebanese father and Icelandic mother. She has been a key figure in Iceland’s MeToo movement, hosting a podcast where she talks with victims of sexual assault. Edda made headlines when her story of sexual assault involved a nationally recognized musician. At first unnamed, it later came out that the musician in question was allegedly Ingó, when he sent her a cease and desist order, claiming her statements referred to him. Ingó, a pop singer, is particularly beloved in the Westman islands, where his appearance at the annual music festival there after the allegations caused controversy. Haraldur Pálsson, manager of sports association ÍBV, made a public statement in which he stated that he was not aware of the effigy in question beforehand. Videos of backstage preparations for the parade, however, clearly show the presence of the offensive effigy in plain sight. When asked if he planned to contact Edda to offer an apology, he stated that he had thought about it, but had not found her number. The Westman islands’ Twelfth Night Parade traditionally lampoons community figures, but the line between good-natured communal ribbing and bullying and worse is not always clear. Also “satirized” this year was former ÍBV football player Heimir Hallgrímsson, who also coached a Qatari football team for some 2.5 years. In this year’s parade, his likeness appeared in an Arab costume. Íris Róbertsdóttir, mayor of the Westman islands, has also weighed in on the case. In an interview with Vísir, the mayor said: “I think it is inappropriate to drag the holiday into this in this way, and I have conveyed these comments to the chairman of the ÍBV. I think that the association should not be dragged into such things […] Things that were okay ten years ago are not okay today and we all just have to go along with our changing society. This was just very inappropriate.” As of yesterday, January 8, Edda Falak has stated on social media that no one has offered her an apology for the incident.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

In light of a recent report on emissions in the capital area, Minister of Environment Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson has called for municipalities to cut down on emissions by reducing the number of diesel vehicles. In the minister’s statement, he specifically singled out Strætó, saying that the energy transition must be expedited in the case of public transportation. In a statement to RÚV, the minister said: “Strætó is currently increasing the number of vehicles […] Right now, very few of the 160 vehicles in service are electric.

In an interview with RÚV, Jóhannes stated: “A significant majority of the buses meet the highest environmental standards governing vehicle import, the Euro 6 emission standards. Claims that Strætó significantly contributes to emissions are based on a misunderstanding. However, we would have liked to have progressed further in the energy transition by this date.” Due to COVID-19 and recent budgetary setbacks, Strætó has not made progress towards its climate goals that it has set out for itself.

They have been free to travel since the Court of Appeal revoked their custody during the middle of last month. When the district attorney filed to extend custody over the two men, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was impossible to establish that there was a strong suspicion that the men had intended to commit acts of terrorism. The District Court of Reykjavík had previously ruled that the suspects must be given the benefit of the doubt, as a detailed evaluation by a psychiatrist had shown that they did not pose a threat. As reported by RÚV, the Court of Appeal recently published two rulings made in October concerning the case. The hearings shed new light on the two defendants, who, at the time, had been in custody and isolation for almost three weeks. The documents show that the men had known each other for a long time and, among other things, were colleagues at a construction company. One of the men has been charged with attempted terrorism. A little over a week before he was arrested, the police had found three 3D printers and four firearms in his home. He was later taken into custody but released a week later as the police had not been able to access his phone. When they finally managed to access his phone, the police discovered messages between the man and the other defendant where they discussed, among other things, Nazism, mass murder, and the purchase and sale of weapons. The two men were subsequently arrested in a large-scale operation by the National Police Commissioner, the district prosecutor, and the Capital Area Police. During the first hearing, the defendant admitted that he had engaged in conversations with the other man: that they were friends and that they shared a special sense of humour. He stated that he was unemployed, having lost his job two months earlier, that he believed in God, and that he had been confirmed into the church. He maintained, however, that he didn’t follow politics and bore no ill will towards politicians. He also stated that the messages he had sent were meaningless and were a product of their odd sense of humour: He was a humanist who cared about LGBT people and people of colour. He added that many people considered his friend to be a Nazi who hated both Jews and Muslims. He could not, however, explain why he had been searching the internet for the date of the annual celebration of the police; he was bitter and hurt but did not want to explain it further. In a hearing one week later, the defendant repeated that his comments were meaningless, that he and his friend shared a dark sense of humour. He was not an angry man and that, generally speaking, he cared for other people. In the third hearing, he reported that the list of chemicals found by the police was not intended for bomb-making but for the production of methamphetamine. In the fourth hearing, he stated that all of their talk about the police annual celebration and the Pride parade – as well as their talk about assassinating political leaders –  had been a joke. He concluded by saying that he was ashamed of his comments. During the first hearing, the other defendant, charged with complicity, described himself as a recluse and admitted that others called him a Nazi. He said that he often offended people by speaking openly, something he was aware of and that had led to his sense of isolation. He stated that he was part of the group the Right Wing and that he believed gays were given too much space in society and should be kept away from children. He also expressed discontent with the many foreigners streaming into the country, who did not work and lived off the system. He added that he was a big weapon and bomb enthusiast. His partner had aired the idea of running people down during the Pride parade but that he hadn’t actively participated in the conversation, that he had just gone along with it. A week later, a statement was taken from him again. During that interview, he said that he realised that the data that the police had gathered would look very bad for him. “He claimed to be a Nazi,” the ruling states. He described the other defendant as being vengeful and bitter as he had been refused a firearms licence; it had taken a toll on him. He denied, however, that he had planned to carry out terrorist acts. Asked why others described him as anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic, he said that it probably had to do with his being a Nazi. He repeated that observation later in the same hearing. In the third hearing, the man’s reasoning had slightly altered, RÚV notes. He stated that all the talk about terrorism, assassinations, and bomb-making was meaningless. He had been drunk when he made those comments. He admitted, however, that he had saved a video of a certain terrorist attack with the words that the terrorist in the attack was “a god” but again claimed that he had been inebriated. During the third hearing, he outlined his concerns about his friend, whom he said had gone too far in his discussions about drone strikes. At that time, he had begun to believe that his friend could carry out such plans and that he had attempted to cool his friend down. The indictment against the men will be registered in the Reykjavík District Court in the middle of this month. The National Police Commissioner raised the alert level after the men were released. No information was received as to whether the office would have a special presence in the district court when the men appear before the court, RÚV notes.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

417,Iceland Review,Annual Limit on Capital-Area Pollution Already Exceeded,2023/01/06,"Pollution in the capital area has exceeded the health-protection limit 19 times so far this year, which is more than the permissible number for an entire year, RÚV reports. The law authorises restricting car traffic on days when the limit is exceeded, but such measures have yet to be implemented. The Environment Agency of Iceland’s air quality metres continually measure the air quality in the city and publishes results every hour. At 6 PM yesterday, the pollution exceeded health protection limits for the nineteenth time in 2023, RÚV reports. According to the regulations of the Ministry of the Environment, the limit can only be exceeded eighteen times a year. There are no precedents for such high levels of pollution in recent years, according to Svava S. Steinarsdóttir, a health representative at the Reykjavík City Public Health Authority. “We haven’t seen such high numbers until the last few years,” Svava told RÚV. The increase goes hand in hand with the increase in car traffic, powered by petrol and diesel. The weather also has its say: calm or little wind combined with the recent day’s frost means that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) hovers over the city for longer periods. Svava stated that exceeding health-protection limits was serious, given that these limits were set to protect citizens. “We may need to consider encouraging people to use more ecological means of transport.” Municipalities are authorised by law to restrict traffic on days when pollution is high. However, that authorisation has not yet been translated into regulation. Svava added that the Environment Agency of Iceland has mentioned radical measures, such as traffic restrictions, in its contingency plans. So far, the agency´s only option is to encourage people to reduce emissions from private cars and studded tires.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
418,Iceland Review,BDSM Community Speaks Out Against Pornography Laws,2023/01/05,"A draft bill to amend the ban on pornography in Iceland has served as an occasion for the BDSM community of Iceland to come out in defence of pornography. Two Pirate Party MPs, Björn Leví Gunnarsson and Arndís Anna Kristínardóttir, submitted a bill last September to revise what some see as Iceland’s antiquated stance on pornography. The bill would lift the current penalties for the publication, importation, sale, and distribution of pornography. Notably, Iceland’s pornography laws are largely unenforced, with the exception of occasional controversies. Now, the Icelandic BDSM Society is also weighing in on the matter. In a public review of the proposed bill, they state: “We at the Icelandic BDSM Society are happy to see that the laws banning the publication and distribution of pornography are finally being removed from the legal system […] Many of our members have struggled with deep shame because of their own feelings and desires. This shame arises from growing up in a society that closes its eyes to the diversity of human sexuality and insists on outdated attitudes about sexual relations, for example, outdated ideas about the purity of women, the privileging of the marital relation between one man and one woman over all other forms of relationships, and beliefs about what is and is not normal sex. BDSM activities are never discussed except as a negative example, and when the negative effects of pornography are discussed, BDSM is often used as an example of sexual violence. The narrative about us never concedes that there are individuals who enjoy it, and that it is not a form of violence, but of consensual play.” The statement also pointed out the outdated nature of the law, coming as it does from an age of print media. Now with modern information technology, it is trivially easy to access pornography, making the enforcement of such laws in the modern day essentially impossible. The society also stated that such laws further marginalize sex workers, making it more difficult to legally and safely make a living. The BDSM community recommends sex education in schools from an early age to combat the effects of non-sex-positive pornography.

419,Iceland Review,Suspicious Package Reported at US Embassy,2023/01/05,"A staff member of the US Embassy in Reykjavík was sent to the hospital yesterday for examination after handling a suspicious package. The staff member in question was not harmed, but was sent to the hospital to ensure they had not come into contact with any hazardous materials. The incident occurred around 14:00 yesterday, January 4. According to a police report, capital area police, a hazardous materials unit from the fire department, and a special police unit were all dispatched to the scene after the package was reported. Engjavegur, the road by the American Embassy, was closed while Icelandic authorities responded. It has since been reopened. Reports also indicate that the suspicious package has since been removed. Authorities are investigating the contents of the suspicious package. Kristinn Gilsdorf, press officer for the American embassy, stated that an incident occurred outside the embassy, leading to the decision to call Icelandic authorities. During the course of the investigation, the American embassy was closed down. Some 60 staff work in the building. Kristinn Gilsdorf stressed that all remained calm during the incident, and that embassy workers are working with Icelandic authorities. The embassy has reopened. Update: According to an initial analysis by the University of Iceland, the contents of the package are stated to have been harmless.        ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
420,Iceland Review,More Support for Children’s Mental Health Services,2023/01/04,"In a recent government announcement, an agreement has been reached to increase mental health services for children. Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Education and Children’s Affairs, has signed an agreement with SÁÁ, an Icelandic organisation that offers treatment and counselling for individuals suffering from addiction. The agreement is intended to increase support for SÁÁ’s services for children after the difficulties posed in the last years by the COVID-19 pandemic, including increasing services and reducing wait times for children who live with relatives suffering from addiction. The agreement is one point in the measures taken by the government to increase government support for children and their families, consistent with laws on integrated services for children’s wellbeing. Regarding the new agreement, Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason stated: “To promote children’s success, it is not enough to focus only on them, but also the environment in which children grow up. The problems of relatives can become the problem of children in one way or another if the children and their families are not considered in a wider context with effective and early support.” Projects to be supported in the agreement include an additional psychologist for children with parents served by SÁÁ, parents admitted to care facilities or receiving outpatient services will receive more information on children’s psychological services, and children’s psychological services are now set to begin at the same time as the parents’ alcohol and drug treatment.

The accident in question occurred shortly before 2:00. According to initial reports, the individuals are in stable condition. The accident occurred east of Fagurhólmsýrar on the South Coast. An SUV and a smaller vehicle were involved in the incident. In total, nine passengers were aboard the vehicles. In total, two coast guard helicopters and one coast guard surveillance plane were dispatched. The two helicopters were sent directly to the scene of the accident, taking the first six individuals. The coast guard plane landed in the town of Höfn, taking the final three. The accident was attributed to the weather, which has left much ice on the roads in the past days. Following the crash, a stretch of Suðurlandsvegur was closed to traffic, but has since been re-opened. Both vehicles are reported as badly damaged. The individuals are reported to have suffered serious injuries as well, but are in stable condition.          ","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
422,Iceland Review,Possible Restrictions for Travelers from China,2023/01/04,"Epidemiologist Guðrún Aspelund says that border screenings are being considered for travelers from China, given the recent rise in infections there. In a recent statement, Guðrún indicated that healthcare systems throughout Europe are under stress, and that possible measures at the Icelandic border may be taken to relieve pressure other nations as well. Regulations on travel are set to be lifted soon in China, meaning that Chinese residents will no longer have to quarantine upon arrival in China from foreign travel. This relaxation has healthcare experts throughout Europe concerned that a wave of Chinese travelers may take advantage of the relaxed regulations. The recent easing of restrictions has contributed to the uptick in infections, and some Western nations have also expressed concerns that authorities there have systematically under-reported figures. Guðrún further stated: “We have less information coming from there regarding numbers for infections, hospitalizations, and cases. There is concern that the situation in China is quite bad and that it could affect Europe. There are also concerns of new varieties coming from China, though it is entirely possible that they may have other origins as well.” Other nations, including the US, India, and the UK have also introduced mandatory testing for Chinese travelers. Chinese authorities have criticized these travel restrictions as being politically motivated. A final decision on the possible restrictions is expected by the weekend.          ","Society,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,0
423,Iceland Review,Bishop Agnes M. Sigurðardóttir To Step Down in 18 Months,2023/01/03,"In her New Year Sermon in the Reykjavík Cathedral, Bishop of Iceland Agnes M. Sigurðardóttir announced that she will step down from her role in 18 months. In her sermon, Agnes noted that she would be publishing her pastoral letter, a step towards completing her duties as Bishop. A pastoral letter is a book that each bishop releases during their tenure that expresses the bishop’s vision of the church and the community. In her sermon, Agnes stated: “In the next eighteen months, I will close this chapter of my life related to my service as Bishop. When I look back over my journey, I am very proud of what I’ve accomplished. I knew that I would have my work cut out for me in the reforms I wanted to make and I’ve often had rough seas during my tenure.” In her pastoral letter, Agnes stresses that the church should have an impact on human rights, equality, the environment, and other issues that concern people’s lives, stating in her sermon that: “The Church’s voice in the human rights cases of asylum seekers and refugees has become louder, above all demanding mercy and grace.” In the next eighteen months, Agnes will complete her visitations to all churches and congregations in the country, ending in Bolungarvík on Sailor’s Day 2024, where Agnes served as minister from 1994-2012. “I want to complete my visitations and my service as Bishop by singing with my former choir in Hólskirkja in Bolungarvík, on the day that will mark 12 years since I left that fine congregation.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
424,Iceland Review,"New Year, New Fees: Important Changes in 2023",2023/01/02,"With the new year, several new regulations, taxes, and fees are coming into effect. Here, we break down the most significant changes for the nation and capital region in 2023. In line with the 2023 budget, the alcohol tariff is set to rise some 7.7.%. The price hike will also disproportionately affect alcohol sold in Duty Free, which was taxed at 10% last year, but will now be taxed at 25%. Fuel is likewise increasing in price. In order to fund infrastructure, the general cost of car ownership is rising significantly. A litre of petrol is set to increase by ISK 16 (0.11 USD, 0.11 EUR), and import duties on electric vehicles are also increasing. In line with the expected 4.9% cost of living increase throughout Reykjavík, the price for admission to the city’s pools will also be increasing, from ISK 1,150 (8.10 USD, 7.58 EUR) to ISK 1,1210 (8.52 USD, 7.98 EUR). Children’s prices are increasing by similar amounts, although residents can still save significantly with pool passes. The cost of preschool registration will also be rising on average from ISK 33,570 (236 USD, 221 EUR) to ISK 35,215 (248 USD, 232 EUR). Changes are also coming to waste management and recycling in the capital area. Icelanders will now need to sort their trash into four bins, and recyclables will no longer be tolerated in the black bin (for trash). Bins will now be sorted into paper, plastic, organic waste, and mixed waste. Alongside these changes come increases in cost, with garbage removal fees in Reykjavík increasing by 20%.

The boy, who is his parent’s second child, measured a healthy 51.5cm (20 inches) and 3.75 kg (8.3 lbs). He was originally expected shortly before the new year, but arrived just after the new year. “It was our wildest dream to have the first child of the year,” said the boy’s father to RÚV. “The midwife told us that the child would be born sometime before noon and that we wouldn’t see her again after that. After that, there was no turning back!” The parents noted how special it was to welcome their child during a time of nationwide celebration. “It was just a great mood,” stated Gunnar. “It was like a big explosion or a carnival!” When asked if the child bore a particular resemblance to any family members, Karlotta, the child’s mother stated that although he took after his father’s side, he was “one of a kind.” In an interview with RÚV, the boy’s parents stated that they had decided on a name, but that it remains a secret for the time being.   .",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
426,Iceland Review,Haraldur Þorleifsson Sweeps Person of the Year Awards,2023/01/02,"Haraldur Þorleifsson, known as Halli, has garnered multiple Person of the Year Awards from various Icelanidc media outlets, including from national broadcaster RÚV, Morgunblaðið, and Vísir. Halli, a 45 year-old designer, gained nation-wide recognition this year when, after the sale of his tech company Ueno to Twitter, he chose to be paid the sale price as wages. Normally in such large sales, the payment comes in the form of stock or other financial instruments, which categorize the sale as capital gains, meaning it is taxed at a much lower rate. Halli, however, gladly paid the higher tax rate, having spoken publicly on many occasions about the benefits he has received from the Icelandic social system. Halli was born with muscular dystrophy and came from a working class background. In statements about his decision to pay back into the Icelandic social system, he cited both healthcare and education in Iceland as keys to his success. Notably, he was one of the highest tax payers in the nation after the sale of Ueno. It’s been a hard year in many ways. Many ups and downs.But on a positive note I was awarded/voted Person of the Year by four of the main networks, programs and publications in Iceland.Which to a shy and awkward kid feels a bit strange but also quite nice.Happy new year! pic.twitter.com/1c9kytL4I9 Since the sale of Ueno, Halli has engaged in numerous philanthropic pursuits, earning a reputation as Iceland’s benevolent tech titan.  One of his best-known projects is Ramp Up Iceland, which is building ramps throughout the nation to increase accessibility for people in wheelchairs.

427,Iceland Review,Justice Minister to Authorise the Use of Electroshock Weapons,2022/12/30,"The Minister of Justice has decided to authorise the use of electroshock weapons among the police. Clear rules will be set for their application and police officers will receive special training, RÚV reports. Over the past few months, the Ministry of Justice has reviewed the possibility of authorising the use of electroshock weapons among police authorities. “We’ve reviewed the use of these weapons in neighbouring countries and have found that they have proven a great success,” Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson told RÚV this morning. “As a result of this review – which has been ongoing, as I’ve reported to the media – we’ve decided to implement their use in Iceland, especially considering that police departments and police officers have called for it.” Jón noted that it was unfortunate that such a step “needed to be taken.” Given the state of affairs, however, it was imperative to ensure the safety of police officers, who have observed a growing threat from the use of weapons in Iceland. The frequency of accidents involving police officers has been on the rise. Jón maintained that the use of electroshock weapons in neighbouring countries had significantly reduced the number of accidents involving police officers and suspects alike. In light of this, the Minister of Justice plans on amending regulations to authorise their use. When asked about the hazards of such an amendment, Jón replied that every weapon came with its risk: “But we believe that that risk, when it comes to bodily harm, is not as great when compared to the resources that the police currently have at their disposal, such as batons.” Jón added that strict and clear rules would be set regarding the use of electroshock weapons, noting that the latest models were equipped with cameras that would make their employment easy to monitor. Furthermore, Jón noted, experience had shown that it was often “enough that the weapons were available,” although they did not always need to be used, for there to be an effect. He expects that the police authorities could begin using these weapons as early as the middle of next year, although such a thing would depend on contractual bids and the training of police officers. When asked if there was a consensus about this amendment within the government, Jón responded thusly: “It’s not been discussed formally. But I have, of course, discussed this repeatedly in the media over recent months and announced that preparations were underway. We’re at a turning point now.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

On its Twitter page this morning, the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA) issued a weather alert for New Year’s Eve (Gamlársdagur in Icelandic, literally Old Year’s Day). “Expect difficult road conditions and even some road closures on New Year’s Eve in South and Southeast Iceland.” IRCA also notes that road conditions may be spoiled on the night before New Year’s Day (which is the time that many Icelanders make their way back home following celebrations with relatives).

It will also snow there, but there will be less snow.” Einar added the caveat that everything could change as far as the weather forecast was concerned although he recommended people finish their errands today (before New Year’s Eve): “It remains uncertain that people will be able to get between places tomorrow,” Einar observed. “Both between different parts of the country and also within towns and neighbourhoods.

429,Iceland Review,Ten Bonfires Scheduled For New Year’s Eve in Reykjavík,2022/12/29,"Reykjavík city officials have announced plans for ten New Year’s bonfires this New Year’s Eve, to take place in various locations in the city. These will be the first New Year’s bonfires since 2019, as the age-old custom was halted for two years due to COVID-19 restrictions. New Year’s bonfires are a tradition reaching back to the 18th century in Iceland, stemming from the belief that if you want to have a clean slate for the new year, you have to symbolically burn away the old year and everything it represents. The tradition was first started by rowdy students but these days, it’s a family-friendly occasion, with people gathering around a fire and singing a few songs. Since New Year’s Eve is linked to folk beliefs and superstitions, sometimes elves or hidden people make an appearance. City workers and local clubs and associations are now preparing the bonfires, according to regulations on what can be burned in such a fire, which is only unpainted wood. The only thing that can stop the bonfires from being lit is the weather – the bonfire plans will not be set in motion if the wind is above 10 m/s [22.3694 mph]. A final decision on whether the bonfires will be lit will be made before noon on New Year’s Eve, based on that day’s weather forecast. In a press release, the city of Reykjavík states that the fires will be watched carefully and put out at a reasonable time. Reykjavík Bonfire locations 2022 Borgarbrennur 2022.

430,Iceland Review,2022 (Year-In Review): The Good News Is …,2022/12/29,"Such is the nature of the news that it often focuses on the negative; bad things tend to happen quickly – and large-scale trends are overlooked. As Swedish author Hans Rosling once pointed out, if newspapers would only be published every 100 years, the messaging, in all likelihood, would be very different, e.g., highlighting how many people were raised above the poverty line, the gradual decline in infant mortality rates, etc. “We’ve cut the number of people living in extreme poverty by half over the last twenty years, but there was never a morning when “POVERTY RATES DROP INCREMENTALLY” dominated newspaper headlines,” Bill Gates wrote in 2018, summarising the ideas of Rosling. In this edition of our year-in-review, we highlight a few positive news stories, intended to balance out the negative – and to remind readers that there is still a lot of good in the world: Last summer, a consultation team was established in order to better ensure the safety of visitors to Reynisfjara beach, a popular travel destination near the town of Vík in South Iceland. As noted in an article in Iceland Review from 2019, the tides that lap the black sand beaches of Reynisfjara possess “an immensely strong undertow, and waves that creep quickly upon travellers.” As of last summer, five travellers had died on Reynisfjara beach since 2013. As noted in a press release from the Icelandic Tourist Board earlier this month, the consultation team recommended the installation of informatory signage on the beach, which has now been completed. In addition to the signs, a 300-metre long chain was strung alongside the parking lot, guiding visitors along a path and past the signs. Cameras were also installed on a mast on the beach ridge, which will stream live video from the beach to the police authorities in Selfoss. The deportation of Hussein Hussein, a refugee from Iraq who uses a wheelchair, in November caused widespread outrage; footage surfaced on social media of authorities forcefully removing him from his wheelchair, in addition to airport authorities attempting to suppress media coverage. In December, however, the District Court of Reykjavík ruled that Hussein’s deportation had been illegal. Following the decision, Hussein and his family returned to Iceland from Greece. Although Hussein and his family have won their suit against the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board, it is still possible for state representatives to appeal the case to the Court of Appeals. At this time, state representatives have made no comments with regard to this possibility. The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration launched a new website in October, offering more detailed information on road and weather conditions. This was good news in light of the often hazardous conditions on Icelandic roads, especially during winter. According to a press release from IRCA, this new website – which replaces the previous road-conditions map on the administration’s site (www.road.is) – is “more advanced, more accessible (especially on smart devices), and will offer greater opportunities for development going forward.” If you’re planning on a road trip, we recommend consulting the website prior to leaving. The Geysir area was originally protected by law in 2020, but its status was officially recognized with a signing ceremony in September. In addition to being a popular tourism destination – and the namesake of all other geysers – Geysir is home to many unique geological features, plant life, and microorganisms, meaning that the area is also important for scientific research. In addition to conserving the Geysir area, the new management plan hopes to place increased emphasis on education on Geysir’s significance. At the ceremony, Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated: “The conservation of the Geysir area is an important step in nature conservation in Iceland, given its unique natural beauty. The conservation plan confirmed today ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy the area as we do today.” Over a dozen rams with scrapie-resistant genes were sold for breeding this fall. Bred in Reyðarfjörður in East Iceland, the sheep carry a special gene, and it is hoped that they will help form a more resilient stock in Iceland. The gene, called ARR, is not found anywhere else in Iceland. It has been recognised internationally as scrapie-resistant, and herds with the ARR gene have already been bred in Europe for some two decades. Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease found in sheep and goats, the ovine equivalent of mad cow disease. There is no cure, and even one case of scrapie can be a death sentence for an entire agricultural community. If a sheep tests positive for scrapie, the entire herd is culled, the entire farm’s hay must be destroyed, and the entire farm and its implements must be sanitised, either chemically or through fire. Even after this deep-cleaning, farmers are not able to raise sheep for a set time, and the scorched-earth policy may even affect neighbouring herds and farms. For the full story on the fight against scrapie and the efforts to breed this new, resistant stock, read more in our article: Good Breeding. In June, spokesperson for the Hellisheiði Power Station announced the construction of a new plant, capable of capturing 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere, increasing the direct air carbon capture at Hellisheiði Power Station tenfold. Named Mammoth, the new facility adds to the existing 4,000 tonnes captured by the plant Orca, which commenced operations at the same location in September 2021, the first of its kind in the world. The plants are a project of Swiss company Climeworks, in collaboration with Carbfix and ON Power. Construction is expected to last 18-24 months before operations commence. 







 As of June of this year, victims of sexual assault in Iceland were granted increased rights: receiving information on the proceedings of the police investigation of their case and permitted to be present at the trial, thanks to legislative amendments passed by Parliament. A spokesperson from Stígamót, a centre for survivors of sexual violence, stated that the changes were a step forward but more needed to be done: “I think this is a turning point and shows that there is will within the system towards victims of violence and there is a strong need for that. As we know, many cases are dismissed and victims are often unhappy with how they are received in the legal system and feel their need for justice is not fulfilled,” Steinunn Gyðu- og Guðjónsdóttir, a spokesperson for Stígamót, stated. In May, a curator of the Akureyri Museum announced that they had likely discovered a 19-verse poem by celebrated poet Davíð Stefánsson (best known for his volumes of poetry). The style of the poem and the handwriting offered a strong indication of its origin, suggesting that it may be among the very first poems that Davíð composed. “We believe that Davíð composed the poem during his school years,” Haraldur Þór Egilsson, curator of the Akureyri Museum, told Fréttablaðið. “It was probably written before Svartar fjaðrir (Black Feathers) was published.” Svartar Fjaðrir (Black Feathers) was Davíð Stefánsson’s first book of poetry, published in 1919. As noted on the website of the Akureyri Museum, the book was “accorded immediate acclaim and established the young author’s reputation. His poems captured the feelings and longings of the general public in crisp, clear and picturesque writing.” In late March, the Icelandic Forestry Association (IFA) held a conference to celebrate an important milestone, namely that forests and bushes had increased to cover over 2% of Iceland. That number may not seem like much, but since 1990, the surface area covered by forest or shrubs in Iceland has increased more than six times over – from 7,000 hectares to 45,000. In 20 years, the number is expected to be 2.6%. “This is big news,” stated Arnór Snorrason, a forester at the IFA research station at Mógilsá. It’s not only forestry efforts that have increased these numbers, but also Iceland’s remaining natural birch forests, which Arnór says have finally begun expanding for the first time since Iceland was settled. In 2006, 36% of Icelandic girls in the 10th grade stated that they had had intercourse, and 29% of boys of the same age. In March of this year, a new survey indicated that those figures had fallen to 24% among girls and 27% among boys. The data originated from an international survey called Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children, which has been carried out in Iceland since 2006. “Decreased alcohol consumption is likely a big factor,” University of Iceland Professor Ársæll Arnarsson, who is a director of Icelandic youth research, told Fréttablaðið. “Drinking among Icelandic teenagers has decreased sharply in recent decades and the same can be said of other countries to which we compare ourselves, though the development there has not been as decisive as here in Iceland.” 







On midnight February 25, All COVID-19 social restrictions were officially lifted. Individuals who tested positive for the coronavirus were no longer required to quarantine, and all disease prevention measures at the border were abolished.

431,Iceland Review,Cost of Dairy to Increase in New Year,2022/12/27,"According to a recent statement by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, the average cost of dairy products throughout Iceland is set to increase in the coming year. As of January 2023, the wholesale price of dairy and dairy products in Iceland will increase by 3.5%. The cost increase, which sets the price at which milk is bought from dairy farmers, is in response to increases in production costs since the price was last assessed in September of this year. According to the Ministry, processing and distribution costs have risen by 5.06% in the last year, in addition to a 2.38% increase in livestock fees. Collective agreements have also caused recent increases to the cost of labour, in addition to the generally high inflation currently affecting the Icelandic economy.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
432,Iceland Review,Efling Negotiation Postponed to Next Year,2022/12/27,"A negotiation meeting between Enfling trade union and SA, originally slated for today, is being postponed to the new year, according to Vísir. The state mediator has said that the next meeting between Efling and the Federation of Icelandic Employers (SA) is now scheduled for January 4. With VR and SGS trade unions having recently agreed on shorter-term contracts as a compromise, Efling remains one of the only major trade unions to have not concluded its negotiations in the current round. The two negotiating bodies last met on December 22, when Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna announced a new offer. Central to Efling’s demands are rising cost of living in Iceland, following the high rates of inflation seen this year. Efling is seen as especially aggressive in its bargaining demands, and Halldór Benjamín Þorbergsson, chairperson of SA, has characterized Efling’s offer as unworkable.

433,Iceland Review,Erla Receives Compensation and Apology over 70s Murder Investigation,2022/12/23,"A 1976 cold-case murder investigation gone wrong finally came to a close today. Erla Bolladóttir will receive damages from the Icelandic government for her stay in custody while the infamous Geirfinnur case was investigated. The Prime Minister has issued a formal apology to Erla. The Icelandic government has reached an agreement with Erla which states that she will receive 32 million ISK [$222,315, €209,383] in damages for her time in preventive custody after being implicated in the investigation of the disappearance of Geirfinnur Einarsson. The agreement with Erla only mentions the preventive custody and the damages are based on the same arguments as the ones who were charged in the case and later acquitted. The 2018 settlement was a landmark moment in the decades-old murder investigation, but Erla was excluded from the compensation awarded, as she had previously been acquitted. Erla stated that she hasn’t quite realised yet that it is all over but that the day has a symbolic meaning for her. “this day, December 22, 1976, 46 years ago, I was released after eight months in brutal isolation,” Erla told RÚV. In addition to her extended stay in custody, Erla Bolladóttir was sentenced to three years in prison for falsely accusing four men, including her brother. In 2018, the five people charged with Geirfinnur’s disappearance were acquitted of all charges in the Supreme Court. That trial did not include the part of the case involving Erla’s sentence or Kristján VIðar Júlíusson and Sævar Marínó Ciesielski. At the time, Erla was a young mother to an infant. Despite the government recognising the hardship Erla faced, Erla’s sentence for false accusations still stands. Last September, a court refused to rehear her case, but while Erla considered taking her case to the European Court of Human Rights, she believed she doesn’t have enough time, as Erla is currently battling cancer. In a declaration published on the government’s official website, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir writes. “The disappearances of Guðmundur Einarsson and Geirfinnur Einarsson have cast a shadow on life in Iceland for decades and marked the lives of several individuals. The state of uncertainty facing the people charged in these cases was mostly cleared up with the Supreme Court acquittal, the Landsréttur ruling of fair damages and laws nr 128/2019, awarding damages compensation to the families of the acquitted who were deceased. The acquitted persons and their families have received apologies for how the case was handled, their unjust sentencing and long imprisonment. But this case involves more people who suffered preventive custody during the investigation unlike any other in Icelandic history. Erla Bolladóttir, a young woman with an infant, was in custody for her alleged participation in the disappearance of Geirfinnur Einarsson from early May 1976 until Christmas of that same year. The conditions facing people in custody at that time were especially hard, as the courts have confirmed. Erla was acquitted of her charges for participating in the disappearance of Geirfinnur Einarsson in a Supreme Court ruling in 1980, so she wasn’t included in the 2018 Supreme Court acquittal or the subsequent actions taken by the government. This makes her position in the case unique. The duration of her imprisonment during the investigation and the conditions she and her child were forced to endure at the time are unprecedented. In order to close the case in regards to formerly charged people, it is natural and fair to issue a special apology to Erla for the treatment she had to endure and its consequences. It is also fair, despite the time that has passed, that Erla also be paid compensation for her stay in custody, according to the compensation that the Appellate Court awarded the people acquitted of charges regarding the disappearances.”  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
434,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Swimming Pools Reopened,2022/12/21,"Capital area swimming pools reopened to the public this morning following a two-day closure due to interruptions in the Hellisheiði geothermal power station. Laugardalslaug opened at 7 am and other city pools at 11.30. The Nauthólsvík geothermal beach opened at 11 am. Several of the city’s pools were closed last Monday due to interruptions in the Hellisheiði power plant operations. Repairs were completed yesterday morning but the swimming pools remained closed while replenishing the city’s hot water reserves. Sufficient hot water reserves are especially important in this recent cold snap, so that Veitur, the city’s utilities company can ensure unlimited services. The reason for the staggered opening hours is that hot water to the swimming pools was limited until 6 am this morning. Swimmers are warned that the outdoor swimming pools will be a little colder than they are used to. Read more: Nothing comes between Icelanders and their swim","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1
435,Iceland Review,Movie Ticket Prices Reach New Heights,2022/12/21,"The price of movie tickets has exceeded ISK 2,000 [$13.95, €13.14] for the first time. Consumers interviewed by Vísir stated that the prices were “striking,” albeit indicative of the economic situation in the country. As reported by Vísir this morning, it was in April 2008 – just before the economic crash – that the price of a movie ticket surpassed the ISK 1,000 mark [$7, €6,57] for the first time. Consumers were upset: “The price of the movie ticket was, in my opinion, shockingly high – but now it’s risen even further; the ticket has reached ISK 1,000, and then you have to buy popcorn, coke, and candy,” a contemporary blogger wrote. Today, fourteen years later, the price of a movie ticket has broken the ISK 2,000 barrier; ISK 2,045 is the new general ticket price in the Sambíó, Háskólabíó and Smárabíó theatres. In other major cinemas, the price of the ticket sits is just under ISK 2,000. Just like fourteen years ago, visitors to the Kringlan shopping centre, whom Vísir spoke to yesterday, were not happy. Alfreð Ásberg Árnason, from Sambíó the theatre, maintained, however, that a movie ticket likely amounted to one of the cheapest forms of two-hour entertainment in the country, arguing that the increase in ticket prices was far from being comparable to other increases elsewhere. Vísir also compiled a list of prices for a few popular food and drink items in Iceland, noting that a hot dog at Bæjarins Beztu costs ISK 600 [$4.20, €3.95](following a considerable price increase from last season). Prices in ice cream shops have also risen: a small “þeytingur” (a specialty mix of ice cream with candy) at Ísbúð Vesturbæjar costs ISK 1,550[$10.80, €10.18] and a double cappuccino at Te & Kaffi costs ISK 835[$5.80, €5.50]. A beer at a bar can hardly be purchased at a price lower than ISK 1,450[$10.12, €9.55], which is exactly the price of half a litre of Tuborg at the Danish pub. The National Statistics Office publishes inflation figures on Thursday, and Landsbankinn predicts that inflation will rise again, to 9.6 percent, before it subsides again in January. Consumers are feeling the price increases, especially now, in the run-up to Christmas. “I can’t even buy Christmas presents for my mother,” Magnús Ingi Halldórsson, a young employee at the Kringlan shopping centre, told Vísir.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
436,Iceland Review,Six Shelters Opened Since Saturday,2022/12/19,"In response to the winter weather conditions, the Red Cross in Iceland, in cooperation with several other organizations, has opened six shelters since the weekend. The shelters can be found in Þorlákshöfn, Kjalarnes, Selfoss, Grindavík, and Reykjanesbær. Additionally, another shelter is being opened in Hella, a small town on Iceland’s South Coast. The recent cold snap has disrupted traffic across the nation, leaving some travelers stranded, whether due to road closures, flight delays, or other reasons. A stuck school bus in Þorlákshöfn required using the elementary school there as a temporary shelter, and there are also reports of many travelers with disrupted plans needing to take temporary shelter at tourist destinations like the Blue Lagoon. Some 1,000 individuals are reported as having used the Grindavík shelter.

437,Iceland Review,All Reykjavík City Pools Closed,2022/12/19,"Problems at the Hellisheiði power plant have led to a significant decrease in the production of hot water for the capital region, leading to closures of all pools throughout the city. Hellisheiði is a geothermal production facility near Reykjavík and the main supplier of hot water to the capital area. The recent disruption there could mean a 20% decrease in hot water production. According to a press statement, teams have already begun the necessary repair work, and the closures will only be in effect for the remainder of the day. Prior to the winter cold snap, several capital area pools had been considered for temporary closures, including Vesturbæjarlaug, Dalslaug, Suðurbæjarlaug, and Ásvallalaug. However, conditions did not require their closure. Now, however, the decision will affect all 18 pools of the capital area, at least for the remainder of the day.

Per an announcement on the government’s website, the agreement was c0signed by the chair and executive director of the Association of Local Authorities and the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs, Infrastructure, and Social Affairs and the Labour Market on Saturday. It is aimed at helping local municipalities “achieve established performance and debt targets according to the current financial plan for the years 2023 – 2027.” Under the terms of the agreement, local taxes will increase by .22% against a corresponding reduction of state income tax. The tax burden on individuals will not change, however. Rather, the agreement deals with the specific transfer of funds from the state to local municipalities. Local municipalities have long called for increased funds to provide services for people with disabilities and are still calling for higher contributions.

439,Iceland Review,Europol Experts Believed Terror Suspects Posed Imminent Threat,2022/12/16,"The two men recently charged with planning a domestic terrorist attack were believed to pose an imminent threat by Europol experts, Vísir reports. A ruling made by the Court of Appeal, published yesterday, notes that the defendants had discussed launching an attack on Parliament, the Ministry of Justice, and the police authorities. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal overturned a ruling by Reykjavík’s District Court revoking the extended custody of two men recently charged with violating Article No. 100 of Iceland’s General Penal Code (pertaining to acts of terrorism). The Court of Appeal ruled that the defendants, who had been held in custody since September, were to be released on the basis of a mental assessment that concluded that they were not a danger to themselves or others. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal published its ruling on its  website. The judgment references the overturned Reykjavík District Court ruling, which notes that the police authorities had consulted with Europol experts on the case. Having reviewed the case files, the Europol experts concluded that the two men were “likely to take imminent action and commit acts of terrorism in Iceland.” As reported by Iceland Review earlier this year, when the defendants were arrested in September, the police seized semi-automatic rifles, including AK-47s and AR-15s, along with ammunition and components for 3D-printed guns. Court documents state that the police also seized an item that could be inserted into an AR-15 rifle so as to make it automatic. Court documents also note that the men possessed material concerning known terrorists and their atrocities, in addition to manifestos. The suspect who is the subject of the ruling denied that he was planning an act of domestic terrorism, maintaining that comments concerning various terrorist atrocities were harmless: they had been made in jest and under the influence of alcohol. The same held for all the other material that they had acquired. Court documents further maintain that the defendant had “begun to pen his own manifesto.” Last night, RÚV reported that the District Attorney would yet again motion for custody.    ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
440,Iceland Review,Cold Spell Continues: Emergency Shelters Open All Day Today,2022/12/16,"The City of Reykjavík has activated an emergency plan and will keep emergency shelters open around the clock today, Vísir reports. An unhoused man hopes that the city will continue keep emergency shelters open 24 hours a day for the duration of the cold spell, predicted to last ten more days at least. The cold weather is expected to have wide-ranging effects. As reported by Iceland review earlier this week, temperatures in Iceland have hovered well below 0°C over the past week – and if weather forecasts prove accurate, temperatures are expected to drop even further this weekend and the next. In response to the cold weather, the City of Reykjavík has decided to keep its emergency shelters open over the next 24 hours (the shelters are normally open from 5 PM to 10 AM). The city will then assess the situation, going forward, tomorrow. Speaking to Vísir, Heiða Björg Hilmisdóttir, Chair of Reykjavík City’s Welfare Council, stated that City of Reykjavík would be reviewing the possibility of expanding shelters: “It’s our priority that no one is made to sleep outside or is turned away at night. If only there were more organisations like Samhjálp, Icelandic Church Aid, and the Icelandic Red Cross that were willing to help, that would be very helpful.” Heiða pointed out that approximately 300 people had availed themselves of emergency shelters in the city this year, of which a hundred came from other municipalities. Other municipalities must get involved: “We’re learning, and we need to listen and evaluate and do as well as we can, but other municipalities besides Reykjavík need to involve themselves.” Ragnar Erling Hermannsson, who has been unhoused for some time, hopes that emergency shelters will be kept open around the clock while the cold spell lasts: “I’m going to see if they keep the shelters open around the clock beyond today,” Ragnar observed. “It makes you wonder if this is just some kind of showmanship by the city. In reality, they have a choice between two or three people dying today or keeping the shelters open while the cold lasts.” Aside from the dangers that freezing temperatures pose to people, the cold spell also makes it difficult for small birds to find food and running water. “It’s hard to find food in this frost,” Hólmfríður Arnarsdóttir, Director of BirdLife Iceland, told Vísir. “There are only a few hours a day of sunlight, so there is less time to look for food and more time that must be dedicated to keeping warm, i.e. the entirety of the night.” Hólmfríður stated that it is extremely important for people to feed the birds and make sure that they get water while the cold weather persists: “It’s best to feed them twice a day: at dawn and at dusk.” On Tuesday, Rangárveitur, which manages the hot-water supply in three municipalities in South Iceland, published a press release to notify residents that the hot-water supply was nearing its limit. In light of the cold, the local authorities, on the advice of Veitur, decided to close three public pools in the area – in Hvolsvöllur, Hella, and Laugaland. The cold could also affect swimming pools in the capital area. Steinthór Einarsson, Director of Operations and Services at ÍTR (Sports and Outdoor Activities), told Vísir yesterday that three public pools may need to be closed: “There are three pools, Vesturbæjarlaug (West Reykjavík), Sundhöllin (Downtown Reykjavík), and Dalslaug (Grafarholt), which we may need to close due to the cold. I just received a message stating that they don’t need to be closed tomorrow (Friday, December 16), but we reassess every day. As there is a very cold forecast ahead, it’s impossible to say for certain.”","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0

444,Iceland Review,"Rights of Fishermen Regularly Violated, According to Chairperson of Icelandic Seamen’s Association",2022/12/14,"In a recent report by RÚV, Bergur Þorkelsson, chairperson of the Icelandic Seamen’s Association, states that the rights of seamen are regularly violated. By law, seamen are allowed up to two months’ of wages if they fall ill or injured during their employment period. However, according to Bergur, “traditional” expectations in the fishing industry mean that it is often difficult for seamen to actually take the leave they are entitled to. This was recently illustrated by the case of a seaman who lost his job after taking a sick leave, which he was legally entitled to, for mental health reasons. According to Bergur, the culture of the fishing industry in Iceland means that seamen are often stigmatized for taking their sick leave. In an industry that has traditionally been very dangerous, this is especially problematic, as seamen feeling able to take off when they are unwell is important for both the safety of the individual and crew. “This is a problem,” Bergur stated to RÚV. “Seamen are all on their own, and need to be tough guys who don’t bother anyone about anything. We get cases like this often. I haven’t seen anything about mental illness until this case, but it’s common for seamen to avoid applying for benefits for fear of losing their jobs.” The violation of the legal rights of seamen is further complicated by the nature of their employment contracts. Because work in the fishing industry is seasonal, a seaman may not be directly let go because of illness. Instead, he may simply not be re-hired for the next season. This grey area allows fishing companies the ability to deny that they may be discriminating against seamen who are simply making use of their legal rights. Many aspects of the Icelandic fishing industry are still very traditional. This is a problem, states Bergur, because in many cases, work contracts can be informal and verbal. Fishing companies may verbally promise fishermen to be re-hired, but when they spend some time ashore, they show up to work after several weeks and find they’ve been let go. In these cases, because the seaman are not even aware of their termination, they have not had the opportunity to look for employment elsewhere, which can severely undermine their job security.  ","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
445,Iceland Review,Refugee Man and Family Previously Deported Win Case,2022/12/14,"The District Court of Reykjavík has decided that the November deportation of Hussein Hussein and his family was illegal. Now, following the decision, Hussein and his family are back in Iceland after they were deported to Greece. In a statement from Albert Björn Lúðvíksson, a lawyer at Claudia & Partners law firm, the firm representing the refugee family, the “legal basis for the deportation was not justified.” Additionally, he stated that: “the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board judged their case to have been overdue. This remains unproven, and even if true, it is insignificant, as the Icelandic State stills bears responsibility for the procedure and any delays that have occurred.” Hussein Hussein is a refugee from Iraq who uses a wheelchair. His deportation in November of this year caused widespread outrage when footage surfaced on social media of authorities forcefully removing him from his wheelchair. The incident also caused controversy, as airport authorities attempted to suppress media coverage of the deportations. At the time of the deportation, many expressed concern that Greece lacked facilities and resources for refugees with disabilities. Although Hussein and his family have won their suit against the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board, it is still possible for state representatives to appeal the case to the Court of Appeals. At this time, state representatives have made no comments with regard to this possibility. Claudia Wilson, the family’s lawyer, has stated that the family arrived in Iceland over the weekend.

447,Iceland Review,Reshuffling of Environmental Agencies Merges Ten into Three,2023/02/01,"Plans to reorganize ten agencies in environment, energy, and climate into three were announced today by the government. The plans were first discussed yesterday at a meeting where Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarsson. He highlighted the need to have fewer, stronger agencies to streamline regulations, while also highlighting the benefits of institutional knowledge that will allow employees to work in and move between what were previously different agencies. Under the new organization, environmental regulations in Iceland will be split between the Nature Conservation and Heritage Foundation, the Institute for Environmental Sciences, and the Climate Agency. Under the new schema, the Nature Conservation and Heritage Foundation would combine Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, and the Nature Conservation Department of the Environmental Agency. The new Institute for Environmental Sciences will bring together the Meteorological Office, the Icelandic Institute of Natural History, the Icelandic Land Survey, Iceland GeoSurvey, and the Natural Research Centre at Mývatn. The new Climate Agency will then comprise of the National Energy Authority and all departments of the Environmental Agency outside of Nature Conservation. The new structure will hopefully bring greater flexibility to energy and environmental policy in Iceland, with projects now more easily transferred between formerly separate agencies. While final details of the new structure have not yet been decided, minister Guðlaugur also announced that they will prioritize job creation in rural areas, and involve the municipalities as much as possible in the decision-making process. In the announcement, the minister stated: “the main goal is to strengthen the institutions of the ministry to deal with the enormous challenges that await us as a society, where climate issues are at the top of the list. With the new institutional structure, the aim is to increase efficiency and reduce waste resulting from redundancy and lack of cooperation. There is also great scope for increasing the number of jobs in rural areas, and creating more desirable workplaces.” The reorganization will affect approximately 600 employees in various agencies, some 61% of which are in the capital region.      ","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0

Travellers required assistance in various regions, including the capital area, West Iceland, Southeast Iceland, and East Iceland. More than 10 cars got stuck in the Grafarholt neighbourhood of Reykjavík around 10:00 PM last night. Only one response centre for travellers was opened, in Kirkjubæjarklaustur, Southeast Iceland, and 34 travellers sought shelter there. Hjördís Guðmundsdóttir, the Civil Protection Department’s Communications Officer, believes that the weather warnings released over the past two days served to prevent serious accidents. “We believe that people just decided to stand with us in all of this,” she stated.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0
449,Iceland Review,Weather Warnings Throughout Iceland Today,2023/01/30,"A state of uncertainty has been declared over the expected storms today, January 30. Yellow and Orange weather advisories are in effect for much of the nation, and experts expect conditions to worsen significantly after noon today. Wind speeds are expected between 15 to 30 m/s [34 to 67 mph]. In light of the conditions, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management has declared a state of uncertainty. Disruptions to traffic throughout Iceland are also expected. Residents are advised not to travel until tomorrow, especially in areas under the orange warning, including South Iceland, the Westfjords, the Faxaflói Bay, and Southeast Iceland. In a statement to Vísir, Einar Sveinbjörnsson, a meteorologist for the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration, said: “From noon and on we expect it to really start howling, with weather conditions quickly worsening after noon. It’s an easterly wind, so we expect it to be especially windy in the south, by Mýrdalsjökull and Eyjafjallajökull, but as of now we are still unsure about the precipitation, whether it will rain or snow.” He further stated: “It’s the kind of storm that passes, and by evening it will largely subside, though not completely because the wind direction will change and the weather will be different tomorrow night.” Travellers can expect road closures throughout the country. Given conditions, closures are considered likely on Hellisheiði, an important stretch of Route 1 connecting the capital region and South Iceland.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0
450,Iceland Review,Greylag Geese Hunting Banned in Iceland,2023/01/26,"Since the start of this year, it has been illegal to hunt greylag geese in Iceland, RÚV reports. The change is due to amendments to an international agreement on the protection of migrating wetland birds, to which Iceland is a party. The Icelandic Farmers’ Association (Bændasamtökin) has requested for the Icelandic government to lift the ban during the autumn season so farmers can protect their pastureland and grain fields from the geese. Hunting of greylag geese has generally been permitted in Iceland between August 20 and March 15, and many farmers have used hunting quota to protect their cultivated land from geese. Most hunting is done in the fall, so the ban has not had much of an impact as of yet. In October 2021, Icelandic hunting association Skotvís reported a drop in greylag goose numbers in the country over the preceding decade. The Icelandic population of the bird had reached a high point in 2011, numbering some 112,000 birds, but figures from 2020 indicated that there were just around 60,000 individuals of the species remaining. The cause of the decrease is not known. At the time, hunters were encouraged to aim their barrels at pink-footed geese instead, whose population was thriving. Both greylag geese and pink-footed geese love a fresh, green snack, and thus they negatively impact grain harvests in Iceland as well as the cultivation of pastureland for livestock. Björn Halldórsson, a farmer in Vopnafjörður, Northeast Iceland, says the geese chomp on fields both in spring and fall. The Farmers’ Association has called on the government to introduce countermeasures to the hunting ban to protect grain harvests and pastureland, especially as the government has a stated aim of increasing grain production in Iceland. Representatives of the Ministry for the Environment, Energy, and Climate told RÚV a hunting policy is in the works that will likely be ready before this autumn.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
451,Iceland Review,Twenty Rescued from Ski Lift in High Winds,2023/01/22,"Twenty people were rescued from a chairlift at the Hlíðarfjall ski area outside Akureyri on Friday afternoon, RÚV reports. The lift stalled when the wire was blown off its spool by a strong blast of wind, stranding about 20 people mid-air for close to two hours. Luckily, the area’s Search and Rescue crew was able to get everyone to safety and no one was injured in the process. Weather conditions are assessed at ski areas every day to determine if it’s safe to open. But while conditions weren’t ideal at Hlíðarfjall on Friday, the wind wasn’t initially so strong that it was thought unsafe to ski and snowboard. By the afternoon, however, the weather had taken a turn for the worse. “From noon, the wind started to pick up again, and it was decided to stop letting people in the lift at 12:30,” explained a post on the Hlíðarfjall Facebook page. “There were still 21 people on the lift. Our chairlifts have built-in wind protection that slows down and stops the lift at certain wind speeds. An attempt was made to drive the lift slowly backwards in the hope of evacuating it, but as the wind continued to increase, it did not work and the lift came to a complete stop.” It was then that Search and Rescue and police were called, explained Hlíðarfjall director Brynjar Helgi Ásgeirson. Ski area staff regularly train in ski lift rescues, but the wind, which had reached 20 m/s [44.7 mph], made the process much more difficult. Luckily, everyone on the lift was back on the ground within two hours of it stopping. Australian Andrew Davis was one of those rescued from the lift. He told reporters that everyone who was stuck kept calm, and no one seemed to be in too bad a shape, though the wind was battering them about. Andrew said he did consider jumping from the lift, as he was confident he could have stuck the landing. But in the end, he decided to wait it out, and saluted the Search and Rescue team for their fast work. Two 13-year-old girls were also amongst the stranded, but Bynjar Helgi said they were “quite upbeat” when they made it back to the ground. After the rescue, those who had been stranded were offered trauma counselling, although no one chose to take it. What everyone did want, however, was the hot chocolate that ski area staff had waiting for them. “After a short while and some hot cocoa, people were smiling and putting this down to experience,” said Brynjar Helgi. Hlíðarfjall was closed on Saturday due to unsafe weather conditions.

452,Iceland Review,Yellow Weather Alert Takes Effect for All of Iceland,2023/01/20,"A yellow weather alert took effect for most parts of the country early this morning. A quick thaw later in the day is expected to produce heavy snowmelt. Residents are encouraged to clear snow away from gutters and icicles from roofs. After six weeks of extreme cold, the weather in Iceland began to warm last night. In an interview with Fréttablaðið yesterday, Teitur Arason, a meteorologist with the Icelandic Met Office, stated that the cold spell was finally coming to an end. “Today is the last day with this extreme cold,” Teitur said yesterday. After warmer weather this weekend, however, it will get cold again – but not as cold as over the past six weeks. “On the one hand, the forecast expects a storm during the early part of tomorrow and then followed by a quick thaw.” Teitur expects that the weather will grow calmer on Sunday but after the weekend, winter weather is expected to set in again. December and January have been unusually cold: “What’s unusual, and what will go down in history, is this cold snap that has been going on for the last six weeks; we’ve seen an unusually long period of extreme frost. The swing in temperature over the course of one day will be quite extreme – and we will probably see the greatest swings in temperature in Víðidalur valley in Northeast Iceland. It was freezing there this morning (-23.4°C), but tomorrow [i.e. today, January 20) ] temperatures will rise to 7°C. That’s a swing of thirty degrees. This owes to the fact that we’ve been sitting in cold air and then a low-pressure system will move into the country and bring a lot of hot air. This is more normal weather at this time of year as opposed to this long cold snap.” In an interview with Mbl.is yesterday, Jón Þór Víglundsson, Public Relations Officer for ICE-SAR (the Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue), stated that rescue teams were at the ready: “The forces are ready, and if they have to, they will be called out.” Difficult road conditions are expected to form over the course of the day.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0
453,Iceland Review,Unusual Snow on Esja Slopes,2023/01/18,"Reykjavík residents and visitors may have noticed a distinctive stripe on Esja’s slopes in the last few days. As can be seen, a white band of snow stretches up Esja’s slope for about 300m. Above the 300m mark there is much less snow, and in many places no snow at all, leading to the interesting band of colour. The Meteorological Office of Iceland claims on social media that they’ve received many questions about the phenomenon and have provided a brief public explanation. Typically, we see the opposite on mountain slopes: white peaks, with bare sides. This is because the higher the elevation, the lower the average temperature. So precipitation falling at the peak is much more likely to be snow, while precipitation falling on the slopes may simply turn to rain. The pattern visible on Esja for the last few days, according to the Meteorological Office, can be explained by a cycle of freezing and thawing. Average temperatures have been very low in Iceland his winter, but data shows brief temperature spikes in low-lying areas. These warming periods, followed by continued cold averages, create a cycle of thawing and re-freezing that compacts the snow, making it denser and icier. However, because the peaks have remained at freezing temperatures, the snow at higher elevations has remained powdery. Powdery snow is of course more susceptible to wind and is more likely to be blown away in storms. The Meteorological Office pointed out the night of January 8-9 as especially windy, with recorded wind speeds of 20 m/s (45 mph). Sure enough, the next day was when the distinctive snow pattern became visible.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
454,Iceland Review,Ice Jam in Ölfusá River Causes Concern for Local Utility Company,2023/01/16,"An ice jam has caused the Ölfusá river to spill over onto the road near Ósabotnar, where the boreholes of the Selfossveitur utility company are located, RÚV reports. The surface of the river has risen by more than a metre in the area above the jam, and the situation is being closely monitored. The water in the river Ölfusá is spilling over onto the road near Ósabotnar, making it impossible for the Selfossveitur utility company to access boreholes in the area, RÚV reports. The overflow is traced to an ice jam that has formed in the river near Efri-Laugardælaeyja; the surface of the river has risen by more than a metre. The ice jam was probably formed by frazils – small pieces of ice that form in water moving turbulently enough to prevent the formation of a sheet of ice – which extend from the bottom of the river to the surface. Sigurður Þór Haraldsson, Utilities Director of Selfossveitur, told RÚV that the overflow does not affect the operation of the utilities at present; the borehole structures are elevated above the water and are, therefore, not at risk of flooding. Rescue teams are at the ready if it becomes necessary to access the boreholes. The outlook at the moment, however, is not bad. “And there’s a dike along there too, of course, which protects the boreholes from ice,” Sigurður stated. In the event of a system failure, however, the boreholes would be difficult to access. “Naturally, we are in touch with the rescue teams constantly. They’re always on hand and ready to sort us out if this happens.” Current forecasts predict warmer weather during the latter part of the week – and with it, in all likelihood, some rain. This could cause a greater overflow. Any changes that may occur are being closely monitored. Oddur Árnason, Chief of Police in Selfoss, told RÚV yesterday that drones are being used to monitor the Ölfusá river, along with select locations along the rivers Hvítá and Stóra-Laxá. “Our people have also examined the conditions at the Skálm river in Mýrdalssandur today as well, to monitor whether there is any risk of ice jams forming in these rivers.” Oddur added that there was no reason to be overly concerned about the jam in Ölfusá at the moment as drone footage doesn’t indicate that there is much pressure accumulating: “The surface of the river is frozen, and it would be nice if there wasn’t a sudden thaw.” The main concern for the authorities is an ice jam forming below the Ölfusárbrú bridge, which could cause the river to spill into the streets, low-lying houses, or basements in Selfoss. In such cases, the river returns to its old channel within a few hours. Oddur told RÚV, however, that there is no reason to be concerned about the possibility at the moment; such eventualities rarely materialise. “But we want to tread carefully. We don’t know if it will rain next weekend. As far as the general public is concerned, however – irrespective of the flooding of rivers and lakes – it’s advisable to clean drains and even step onto the street and open the drains. Just to clear any blockages.” If people aren’t sure where gutters are located in the street, they can  visit www.ja.is and access the 360-degree images on the website. “If all of us do this, it will prevent any unnecessary overflow,” Oddur concluded.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
455,Iceland Review,Energy Credit Market Means Only 13% of Icelandic Energy is Renewable in Origin,2023/01/12,"In figures recently released by the National Energy Authority on 2021 energy usage in Iceland, it has come to light that Icelandic energy may not be as “green” as previously thought, due to the energy credit market. According to the latest numbers, in 2021, 63% of energy used in Iceland was produced by fossil fuel, 24% by nuclear power, and only 13% by renewable energy sources. This may come as a surprise to many, as Iceland is often lauded as a leader in the energy transition, with a power grid entirely dependent on hydroelectric and geothermal power. And to be sure, the actual electricity flowing into Icelandic homes and businesses is still green, as Minister of Environment, Energy, and Climate Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarsson stressed in recent comments: “It doesn’t change the fact that all our energy is green. This is simply an arrangement that is supposed to encourage investment in producing more green energy. That’s the thinking behind this.” The energy credit market, however, allows foreign companies to “buy” Icelandic green energy. In this way, consumers in Europe might choose to buy green certificates of origin for their energy, even though the energy actually powering their house is sourced from a coal plant. Of the energy actually produced in Iceland in 2021, some 70% was hydroelectric, 30% geothermal, with a negligible but growing percentage of wind power, at .03%. Fossil fuels accounted for .01% of all energy produced in Iceland in 2021. In contrast to Iceland, a majority of energy produced in Europe is still nuclear or fossil fuel. In order for energy providers to be able to certify that they provide 100% renewable energy, it is required that they purchase at least as many renewable energy credits as they produce. This market dynamic has led to a curious situation: although the electricity flowing into Icelandic homes and businesses is 100% renewable in origin, Icelandic consumers are now being made to pay extra for green energy certification. Some 90% of energy produced in Iceland is now sold on renewable energy credit markets, leaving Icelanders with the “sins” of fossil fuel and nuclear energy. Berglind Rán Ólafsdóttir, director of ON (Orka Náttúrunnar) stated to Vísir: “As it stands now, we can expect increases from five to fifteen per cent coming months and years. The development will depend on how the energy credit market in Europe further develops.”","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
456,Iceland Review,Swans Freeze to Ice During Cold Snap,2023/01/07,"Residents in Hafnarfjörður, a small town just outside the capital area, have rescued multiple swans that have frozen to the icy surface of Hamarkotslækur creek during a recent spate of desperately cold weather in the country, RÚV reports. Local bird lovers in the group Fuglavinur (‘Bird friends’) encourage people to help any birds they see in such a predicament. Swans freezing to ice is unfortunately not a rare occurrence, and it’s not even the first year the birds have frozen to the creek, which runs through the centre of Hafnarfjörður, says Guðmundur Fylkisson. Guðmundur is a member of the Facebook group Project Henrý, which has had permission to look after the birds of Hamarkotslækur for over a decade. “Last night, a few neighbors rescued a chick—it was a swan,” Guðmundur told reporters. “Around Christmas, there were two swans [frozen stuck] here. About a year ago, maybe two, there was one that had been stuck for probably close to 24 hours.” Guðmundur personally freed the latter three birds, one of which, he told Iceland Review, “was put up in a prison cell over New Year’s. He was cold and worse for wear—ravens had started nibbling at him. After a two-night stay in the cell, he was tagged and then released. He’s one of the birds that’s now on the creek.” Only in Hafnarfjörður For whatever reason, this doesn’t happen to other birds, says Guðmundur. “It’s just the swans. I’ve never seen this happen to geese or ducks.” Moreover, this pitiable phenomenon seems to be restricted to the creek in Hafnarfjörður; Guðmundur says he’s never heard of it happening anywhere else. Guðmundur urged residents to help any birds they can, as the swans only injure themselves when they struggle to get free. “When they get loose, they tear their feathers and bleed and when the blood and snow mix, it looks pretty bad,” he remarked. “They’ve injure their breasts doing this.” ‘They don’t bite hard’ Swans have a reputation for being aggressive, so Guðmundur understands that people might be hesitant to try and free them from the ice. But they needn’t be, he says, if certain precautions are taken. “You have to be careful about their wings and beaks, that they don’t poke you in the eye, but they don’t bite hard. I usually just use a blanket or a towel and spread it over their wings to keep them from thrashing too much. They haven’t hurt me so far.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
457,Iceland Review,Engineer Wages Advertising War Against Aluminium Factories,2023/01/04,"Electrical engineer Reynir Þór Eyvindsson has bought advertising time for a period of some years on national broadcaster RÚV during the holidays, with the intention of reminding the nation of some inconvenient truths about aluminium production in Iceland. His advertisements come in response to what he identifies as a preponderance of aluminium industry PR in the media during the holidays, which could be seen as “greenwashing” an activity that has a worse environmental impact than many may think. Aluminium production is a highly energy-intensive industry which has found a home in Iceland thanks to the supply of green electricity. Environmental critics, however, have pointed out that the use of geothermal and hydroelectric power do not simply neutralise the environmental impact of this industry. The text of the advertisements reads in English: “Icelandic Aluminium Plants: Pay very little in taxes. Emit twice as much CO2 as the entire automobile fleet.  Around 1.5 million tonnes of toxic sludge are produced annually. This could fill the outdoor swimming pool at Laugardalur 1,500 times over. Happy New Year, Reynir Eyvindsson.” In a statement to Morgunblaðið, Reynir said: “This is a highly political issue. Not everyone agrees that this highly polluting industry should be here.” Reynir admits that advertising slots on RÚV during the holidays are rather expensive, but he says he doesn’t have much else to do with his money. He pays for the advertisements out of his own pocket, but recognises that they may not stand up to the production quality of the aluminium industry’s professional advertisements. Nevertheless, he counts the money as well spent. Read more about protecting Iceland’s environment here.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

This represents the coldest recorded temperature since the particularly harsh winter of 1918.

But in truth, it did not sustain this low for very long. It’s letting up now, but could just as easily become even colder with no wind.” Notably, the recorded temperature in Viðidalur does not necessarily reflect conditions in parts of the capital region. Seltjarnes, for example, only dipped to -4°C (25°F). The weather station in Viðidalur has been in operation for several years, and has measured some of Reykjavík’s coldest temperatures since it came into use.

462,Iceland Review,Winter Weather Wreaks Havoc,2022/12/17,"Snowstorms in south and southwest Iceland wreaked havoc on Saturday, leading to road closures, the opening of additional emergency centres, dozens of calls to ICE-SAR to rescue people from cars stranded on roadways, and flight disruptions, RÚV reports. See Also: It’s Going to Be a White Christmas Roads around south and southwest Iceland—including the pass over Hellisheði and Mosfellsheiði heaths, Þrengsli, and around Kjalarnes peninsula—closed on Saturday, with teams struggling in low visibility and dense snow to clear a path, even as abandoned cars on the roadway slowed the process considerably. “Yes, there’s been plenty to do,” said ICE-SAR’s information officer Jón Þór Víglundsson. “Not long ago, there were reports of cars on Mosfellsheiði and rescue teams were called out to deal with it. There were as many as 15 cars. Right as they were getting there, we got news of cars on Kjósskárðsvegur that were in trouble. So this is basically the situation in the southwest, from Borgarfjörður to east of Selfoss. People are finding themselves in trouble.” Indeed, roads in and around Selfoss were impassable after a night and morning of heavy snow and Grétar Einarsson, foreman of the Icelandic Road Administration in Selfoss, also noted that cars that had gotten stuck on roadways were slowing the clearing process significantly—as were vehicles following directly behind the snowplows as the roads were being cleared. But while he urged people to stay inside until roads had been sufficiently cleared, Grétar remained jolly. “People asked for Christmas snow and their prayers were clearly answered!” Most rescue call-outs in Grindavík Rescue teams responded to dozens of calls all over the country, but the most calls came from around the town of Grindavík, located on the southern coast of the Reykjanes peninsula. “We’ve got snow accumulation, wind, sleet, driving snow, hailstorms, some thunder—it just doesn’t quit,” said Bogi Adolfsson, who leads the Þorbjörn Search and Rescue team in Grindavík. The team’s main challenge on Saturday was helping people were stuck on Rte. 43, also called Grindavíkurvegur, which closed that morning and stranded a number of people, mostly foreign tourists, who were trying to make their way back to the capital. The Red Cross opened an aid station in the afternoon to provide shelter for those who’d been rescued. Shortly after noon on Saturday, there were a reported 40 cars stuck on Grindavíkurvegur, many of which were driven by tourists hoping to go to the Blue Lagoon. “A number of tourists have plans and there’s a steady stream of people headed toward the Blue Lagoon,” said Gríndavík detective superintendent Ásmundur Rúnar Gylfason. “They’ve just decided that they’ve got to go to the Blue Lagoon.” Many people en route to the popular destination were not aware of the road closure, and so police and rescue teams were stationed at the intersection with Reykjanesbraut to turn them away, but that caused traffic snares as well. Further east along the southern coast, in Þorlákshöfn, about a dozen people spent much of the day at the emergency centre that had been opened in the primary school. Many of these individuals had had to spend the night there. “These are people who ICE-SAR rescued from their cars and brought here,” said school principal Ólína Þorleifsdóttir, who said they tried to make those who were stranded comfortable with blankets, bread, cookies, and coffee. Flight disruptions Snow accumulation on the runway at Keflavík necessitated the airport closing temporarily for both departures and landings. All flights to Europe were delayed due to weather on Saturday morning, some for upwards of four hours. A flight from Stockholm, Sweden had to land amidst lightning during the latter half of the day. Both Icelandair flights from Reykjavík to Ísafjörður in the Westfjords had to be cancelled on Saturday, as did the first flight from the capital to Egilsstaðir in East Iceland. Flights from Reykjavík to Akureyri in North Iceland were delayed and one long-delayed flight from Akureyri to Reykjavík took off five hours after it was scheduled, only to be forced to return to Akureyri half-way to the capital due to weather conditions. As of 7:00 PM, Icelandair had cancelled all flights until the morning, that is, 11 flights to North America, a flight to London Gatwick, and another to Copenhagen. All foreign passengers and those on connecting flights were put up in hotels at the airline’s expense.

464,Iceland Review,"Safety Signs, Cameras Installed at Reynisfjara Beach",2022/12/13,"Informatory signage has been installed at Reynisfjara beach to better ensure the safety of tourists. Cameras, mounted on masts on the beach ridge, will relay a live stream from the beach to the police authorities in Selfoss. As noted in an article in Iceland Review from 2019, the tides that lap the beautiful black sand beaches of Reynisfjara beach – a popular travel destination near the town of Vík in South Iceland – possess “an immensely strong undertow,” with waves that “creep quickly upon travellers.” As of last summer, five travellers had died on Reynisfjara beach since 2013. In response to these tragedies, a consultation team was established last summer in order to better ensure the safety of visitors. The consultation team recommended the installation of informatory signage on the beach, which has now been installed. In addition to the signs, a 300-metre-long chain has been strung along the parking lot, guiding visitors along a path and past the signs. Cameras, which have been installed on a mast on the beach ridge, will also stream live video from the beach to the police authorities in Selfoss. “The signs emphasise information,” a press release from the Icelandic Tourist Board reads, “aiming to make the information accessible and interesting, explaining what can be done in the area – as opposed to simply highlighting what is prohibited. One illuminated sign, which relays information from the Icelandic Road Administration’s wave-prediction system; three big informatory signs, one of which highlights the dangers of the undertow; and six guiding signs have been installed.” The press release also notes that the Reynisfjara beach will never be closed to the public. Instead, the beach will be divided into zones, which will serve to guide visitors based on conditions: a flashing yellow light indicates that visitors should not enter the yellow zone, and a flashing red light indicates that visitors should not enter the red zone (i.e. not past the illuminated sign). Visitors are encouraged to stay on the beach ridge, which affords a safe view of the beautiful scenery. “The safety measures at Reynisfjara beach will only extend as far as signage, and no lifeguards will be employed at this time. Such a thing could, however, prove a logical next step – if only during those days when conditions are labelled ‘red.’ In order to finance such measures, landowners would need to collect fees from visitors.” Lastly, the parties affiliated with the consultation team hope that the new safety measures will mean that visitors to the beach will become “more mindful of hazards” and comport themselves accordingly. “Signs, no matter how well designed, will not stop anyone from venturing near the tide; they are, however, useful in keeping most visitors within a safe zone, so as to enjoy the beach in all its majesty.” The consultation team comprised representatives of landowners, the South Icelandic police, the Icelandic Tourist Board, ICE-SAR, the Icelandic Road Administration, and the Katla Geopark.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
465,Iceland Review,Danish Breeders to Import Icelandic Mink,2022/12/12,"Two thousand Icelandic minks are set to be exported to Denmark to help reconstitute their breeding population. Mink breeding will become legal again in 2023, and Icelandic mink are set to play a key role for Danish mink farmers. The entire Danish mink population of some 13.5 million animals was controversially culled in 2020 over fears of human-animal transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The cull was carried out without the proper legal authority and caused billions of Euros in damages to the industry. The incident has been the cause of ongoing political controversy in Denmark. In addition to Icelandic mink, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish, and Spanish mink will also be imported. Icelandic mink are said to be especially important in the renewal of Danish mink farming for their genetic similarity to the now-culled Danish stock. The political fallout of the 2020 mink cull still continues in Denmark with regard to disputes over the cost of import and tests for the new animals. Representatives of the mink farming industry claim that the state should bear responsibility for the costs, after the illegal cull.  ","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
466,Iceland Review,Icelandic Cod Stock Endangered by Warming Waters,2022/12/09,"Unprecedented changes to the waters surrounding Iceland may put the nation’s cod stock in danger, a professor in biological oceanography has told Fréttablaðið. A new era in our ocean biosphere is under way. Katherine Richardson is a professor in biological oceanography at the University of Copenhagen and the leader of the ROCS (Queen Margrethe’s and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir´s Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Ocean, Climate, and Society). Among the ROCS’ research projects is analysing core samples extracted from the ocean floor in Reykjanes by a vessel operated by Iceland’s Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (Hafró). The results of the research are being introduced at a conference in Reykholt, Fréttablaðið reports. “We can expect changes to fish stocks around Iceland, a decrease in certain species, e.g. cod, which prefer colder waters, and an increase in species that prefer warmer waters, e.g. mackerel and sardines,” Katherine told Fréttablaðið. New research shows that formerly unknown changes are occurring in the waters surrounding Iceland. Katherine emphasises, however, that it’s currently not possible to generalise regarding the effect of these changes on fish stocks in Iceland. “We’re entering a new era when it comes to the ocean biosphere, including fisheries,” Katherine observed, adding that those who participate in the fishing industry need to be aware of these changes. As reported by Fréttablaðið this summer, the cod quota will be lowered by 13% next year; Iceland’s Marine & Freshwater Research Institute has overestimated cod recruitment over the past few years. Fréttablaðið also quotes Daði Már Kristófersson, professor of economics at the University of Iceland, who stated that there are plenty of unknowns when it comes to the ecosystem surrounding Iceland – and that it is surprising, given the stakes, that Icelanders have not investigated these ecosystems. Research indicates that capelin – a cold-water fish and a key food for cod – propagation patterns are changing. As noted in an article in the New York Times in 2019, ocean temperatures around Iceland have increased between 1.8 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 20 years.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
467,Iceland Review,"North Atlantic Nations Reach Agreement on Mackerel Quota, Dispute Allocation",2022/12/08,"Iceland has reached an agreement alongside Norway, the EU, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and the United Kingdom on the maximum catch for mackerel next year. The new quota agreement for 2023, which was signed yesterday, December 7, will be set at 782,066 tonnes. The new limit is 13,000 tonnes less than this year, in accordance with the suggestions made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). So far, the national allocation of the quota has not yet been decided between the signatories, despite numerous meetings these years. Iceland currently demands 16.5% of the quota, or 129,000 tonnes. Negotiations are set to resume in February of next year, and will need to reach an agreement by the end of March, as the fishing season for most nations will begin in the first half of the year. It is important for the nations to reach an agreement. If they do not, and they individually allocate their catch according to national demand, it is all but certain that the total catch will far exceed scientific recommendations for sustainable levels of fishing in the North Atlantic. Bjørnar Skjæran, Norwegian Minister of Marine Fisheries, stated with regard to the recent agreement: “I am very pleased that we have now finally set a total quota for mackerel. This is something we have worked for for a long time and which means a lot for the fishermen, and for sustainable management of this important fish stock. Despite several rounds of negotiations throughout 2022, there has still not been a complete agreement on the issues of distribution of the stocks and management plan for mackerel. We hope that the remaining questions will be resolved at the beginning of next year.” The agreement can be read here.      ","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
468,Iceland Review,Wet and Cold: Children Rescued from Elliðavatn Lake,2022/12/07,"Three boys between ages 10 and 11 were rescued by the capital area fire department yesterday when they fell through the ice on Elliðavatn, a popular lake near Reykjavík. The boys had walked out onto the ice, which then broke under them. However, the fire department was able to respond in time, and the boys made it back onto dry land safely, albeit rather cold and wet. The incident was reported to the fire department around 17:00 this last Monday. By the time the fire department had arrived, the boys had managed to make it to a small island in the lake, from which they were then rescued by the responders. Sveinbjörn Berentsson, station officer at the capital area fire department, stressed in a statement to Vísir that going out on the ice is always dangerous, and simply staying off the ice is the safest thing to do. It has also been a warm winter until a recent drop in temperature, meaning that the lake ice had only a short time to form. The local school the boys attend has also sent advisory notices to parents, warning them of the danger. Teachers are also reported as having discussed the dangerous with their students following the incident.    ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
469,Iceland Review,Teigarhorn: Average Temperature Has Risen 2°C Since 1880s,2022/12/06,"The average temperature in Teigarhorn, East Iceland has risen by 2°C since measurements began in the late 19th century, Austurfrétt reports. Five of the area’s warmest summers have been recorded after the turn of the century. Last week, Kristín Björg Ólafsdóttir, a climatologist with Iceland’s MET Office, marked the 150th anniversary of continuous temperature measurements at Teigarhorn by giving a talk in Löngubúð in Djúpivogur. As noted in her lecture, the Danish Meteorological Institute began conducting measurements in Djúpivogur in 1872 but measurements were moved to Teigarhorn in 1881. The average temperature in Teigarhorn has risen by 2°C over that time (meanwhile, Earth’s average global temperature has risen by 0.8°C since 1880). Kristín also noted that three of the area’s warmest summers had recently passed, i.e. in 2014, 2016, and 2017. The coldest summers, on the other hand, occurred well over 100 years ago, in 1881, 1887, 1888, and 1892. Five of the area’s warmest summers have been recorded after the turn of the century. As noted by Austurfrétt, Teigarhorn distinguishes itself from other places in Iceland as the site where the country’s hottest temperature was recorded: 30.5°C on June 22, 1939. (The original measurement was 30.3°C, but as the thermometer was later deemed 0.2°C too low, the measurement was revised). Kristín also pointed out that the annual average number of “all-white” days (when the ground is covered by snow) in Teigarhorn only amounted to 18, i.e. just over two weeks. Austurfréttir reports that Teigarhorn was awarded Centennial Observing Station status from the World Meteorological Organisation for over 100 years of continuous meteorological measurements. This is the second weather station in Iceland to be awarded the status (the first was in Stykkishólmur).",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
470,Iceland Review,Environmental Associations Call for Ban on Marine Fish Farming,2022/12/05,"This fall, when aquaculture company Arnarlax went to harvest their Westfjords fish pens, a hole in the pens let some 80,000 salmon escape.  Now, some 25 environmental groups have signed a petition for marine fish farming to be banned.  Citing the potential impact on both the environment and wild fish populations, the Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) is levelling a fine of ISK 120 million [USD 857,700; EUR 819,200] against Arnarlax. Authorities estimate Iceland’s wild salmon population at around 50,000 fish, meaning that the recent escape could have potentially severe consequences, including both increased competition for food, and the possible spread of diseases and parasites from the high-density farm fish. Aquaculture has exploded in recent years, with marine fish farming trying to supply both domestic and international demand for salmon. In 2015, marine fish farming produced around 3,000 tonnes annually. In 2021, marine fish farming in Iceland produced some 46,000 tonnes of salmon, a 15-fold increase. Icelandic aquaculture is now a major industry. However, many environmental organisations are concerned that the quick growth of this industry has come at an environmental cost, with the recent Arnarlax incident just being the most recent. In addition to calling for the government to draft a resolution for the ban of marine fish farming, the recent petition has also called for increased protections for the 2,250 farms that rely on income from salmon fishing in rivers. These farms also rely on the reputation of Icelandic nature as pristine, and should Iceland’s wild fishing stocks be depleted or changed, it is not clear whether these farms could still operate. There is also another dimension to the marine fishing question, namely that of foreign investment in Iceland. Many marine fish farming concerns are foreign, largely Norwegian, and environmentalists have called on the government to protect Icelandic nature from the effects of foreign capital.

471,Iceland Review,Sustainability Conference Centres Around Iceland’s Climate Goals,2022/12/01,"Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Mayor of Reykjavík Dagur B. Eggertsson met today with other ministers and officials for the founding of the Council for Sustainability. The meeting was held at 14:00 today in the House of Collections. Pursuant to Iceland’s being a signatory of the Paris Agreement, Iceland is obligated to cut greenhouse emissions by 40% by 2030. Additionally, Icelandic policy aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. Mechanisms exist to incentivize the fulfilment of these goals, and if Iceland fails in this, then the consequences may prove costly. Although heating and electricity are covered by renewable energy, much of Iceland’s energy goes towards energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium smelting. Iceland is still also very dependent on cars, especially in rural parts of the country. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir gave a speech at the meeting, calling for a more ambitious approach to Iceland’s climate goals. The Council of Sustainability will be chaired by the Prime Minister, and will work in cooperation with local municipalities, parliament, NGOs, and private companies. According to Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the energy transition must be a top priority, but it must also act as a “guiding light in all areas of society.”","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
472,Iceland Review,November One of the Warmest Ever,2022/12/01,"Although this November has been one of the warmest on record, it has not quite broken any records. Much of Iceland has experienced unusually warm temperatures for this time of year, with no snow so far in the capital region.  In a recent Facebook post, Meteorological Office specialist Einar Sveinbjörnsson published a short report, stating that ultimately, the record was not broken. In Reykjavík, the average temperature for November was 5.1°C (41°F). While not an all-time record, it is nevertheless the highest average temperature for November in the 21st century. The all-time record was in 1945, when average November temperatures reached 6.1°C (43°F). Likewise, it was also unusually warm in Akureyri, but not record-breakingly so. The November average was recorded at 4.2°C (40°F), with an all-time record of 4.8°C (41°F) in 1956. However,  Einar notes that an error in data entry may have affected the number for this month. When asked by Vísir whether these unusual temperatures were anomalies or parts of a larger trend, Einar stated: “The short answer is that it is anomalous, and that we do get these warm Novembers every decade or so. But on the other hand, if these patterns, which we know so little about, begin to accelerate, then we can begin to talk about climate change.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
473,Iceland Review,"Earthquakes by Bárðarbunga, Mýrdalsjökull",2022/11/29,"Around 1 AM this morning, a magnitude 3.8 earthquake was recorded by Bárðarbunga, a volcanic system underneath Vatnajökull. A relatively inactive system, Bárðarbunga last erupted in 2014 in the Holuhraun eruption, which caused relatively little disruption except for decreased air quality in the surrounding area. The same fissure system has also seen significant seismic activity to its southwest, in the highland area between Vatnajökull and Mýrdalsjökull. Significant quakes (magnitude 3.0) were also detected by Góðabunga last night, a volcanic system under Mýrdalsjökull, a glacier on the South Coast of Iceland. These quakes occurred approximately 20 minutes after the activity under Bárðarbunga. Reports from the Meteorological Office indicate that the recent quakes on the South Coast have not affected settlements in any way. Several other significant quakes were detected by Mýrdalsjökull on Saturday night, November 26. Nine earthquakes were recorded around 4 AM, with the largest recorded on Sunday at 3.4. Lovísa Mjöll Guðmundsdóttir, natural scientist at the Meteorological Office, stated to RÚV that the recent activity can be attributed to warmer-than-average weather. Glacial melt and flooding atop Iceland’s many volcanic systems have been known to trigger both seismic and volcanic activity, as often happens in the Grímsvötn system. The most recent quakes underneath Mýrdalsjökull are attributed to activity in the Katla system. “There are changes in tension when there are warming periods, and it has been unusually warm for this time of year,” stated Lovísa. “It often comes in pulses like this, but it is often a long time between these periods.” See the Meteorological Office of Iceland for more information.    ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
474,Iceland Review,"80,000 Farmed Salmon Unaccounted For",2022/11/28,"When Arnarlax, an Icelandic aquaculture company, harvested their fish pens in Arnafjörður this October, they only found some 18,000 salmon. According to their records of how many salmon were supposed to be in the pen, upwards of 80,000 salmon were unaccounted for, likely having escaped from the damaged pens this summer. Now, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) has decided to fine Arnarlax ISK 120 million [USD 857,700; EUR 819,200] for having failed in their responsibility to report the extent of the escape. According to Arnarlax records, some 130,000 fish have been raised in the pens in question between October 2020 and July 2021. Official Arnarlax records recorded losses of around 33,000 fish, but when time came for harvest this October, the fish stocks were much lower than expected, leaving more than 80,000 unaccounted for. This past August, Arnarlax did report a hole in one of its Arnarfjörður pens. According to MAST at the time, Arnarlax responded appropriately to the incident, repairing the damaged pen and reporting the incident to the authorities. Since then, however, many farmed salmon have been found in the region’s rivers, including the Mjólká river, which is near the facility. Now, however, MAST is calling attention to the discrepancy between Arnarlax’s reported figures at the time of the incident and the most recent figures from the harvest. Two months before the incident, significant changes in the feeding pattern of the pen were recorded, which should have alerted Arnarlax to a potential leak in the pen, claims MAST. MAST states it is taking the incident seriously, as escaped farmed fish can pose a risk to wild fish populations. MAST claims that the incident could have been prevented by better oversight. The fine it is now levelling against Arnarlax is to highlight the severity of the negligence and potential impact to the environment.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

After repeated demands by authorities that their owner improve their conditions, authorities have finally been forced to confiscate the cattle after it became clear the farmer in question would not cooperate. Both police officers and representatives from MAST, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, were at the scene, reports RÚV. The owner in question is said to have a long history of mistreating his animals. Sheep and horses have been previously taken from the farmer to be slaughtered, as they were too maltreated to be rescued. Some cattle confiscated in the latest episode will likewise be slaughtered, but many of the cows will be allowed to live and given new homes. Ellen Ruth Ingimundsdóttir, district veterinarian for Southwest Iceland, stated that such cases are very difficult for all involved: “It’s a long and difficult story. We decided that it was no longer possible to give deadlines that weren’t met […] We don’t take animals from people just because we want to. We need to follow the law and we need to do this in consultation with locals so that it doesn’t hurt the animals.

477,Iceland Review,Kirkjufell Access Ban May be Illegal,2022/11/16,"A suggested ban on winter hiking at Mt. Kirkjufell may be illegal, states travel association Útivist. Following a fatal hiking accident on Mt. Kirkjufell this October, the landowner suggested a ban on hiking during the winter. Mt. Kirkjufell, a mountain known for its iconic shape, has attracted many tourists in recent years, especially since its inclusion on the popular television show, Game of Thrones. The fatality was the third in four years.   Iceland, like many other nations in Northern Europe, has traditional legal rights known as the freedom to roam in English. These rights grant the public access to lands owned publicly or privately. Notably, these rights exclude economic activities. Many tourist sites have begun charging fees for parking and bathroom infrastructure, leading to a debate between where the line is drawn between these traditional rights and the necessities of mass tourism in Iceland. The Environment Agency of Iceland states: “Walking is permitted on uncultivated land. However, please avoid taking shortcuts over fenced areas, pastures and private plots. Follow the rules in areas under special wildlife or vegetation protection. Follow marked footpaths, where they exist. These paths make for a safer trip, as well as reduce wear and tear on sensitive natural elements. Landowners may not hinder passage of walkers alongside rivers, lakes and ocean, or on tracks and paths. There should be a gate or style close to any hindrances.”   Last week, landowners of Kirkjufell stated that the mountain may be closed to hiking until mid-June. The landowners stated that foreign tourists often do not recognise the dangers posed by the mountain, and decide to hike the popular mountain even in dangerous weather conditions. The travel association stated its understanding of the landowners’ actions, but stated that other precautions must be taken that still maintain the right to access. In an official resolution, Útivist stated: “The landowner’s ban on walking on the mountain is not in accordance with the law on public rights. The board points out that it is not possible to put the trips of inexperienced, poorly equipped hikers, who do not know the conditions, and the trips of organized groups […] under the same umbrella. The travel association Útivist has organized trips to Kirkjufell and has always ensured that safety is guaranteed as much as possible. The board of Útivist reiterates its understanding of the actions that the landowners have taken in light of the special circumstances, but at the same time does not consider it a reason to limit the access of well-equipped and trained hiking groups […] In this light, the board of Útivist believes it is important that time be used to find other and more suitable ways to reduce accidents and deaths at Kirkjufell, including by installing information signs about the dangers in frequently visited places.”  ","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0
478,Iceland Review,British Army Off the Hook for Mining of Rauðhólar,2022/11/16,"New information has come to light regarding the destruction of Rauðhólar, or the Red Hills, a natural area of craters by Elliðavatn lake in the capital area. Originally, some 80 of these craters stood on the edge of Reykjavík, but their numbers have decreased due to gravel mining. Previously, it had been believed that the British military levelled much of this area for construction material during the Second World War, with some calling this one of Iceland’s first natural disasters of the modern era. However, recent evidence reported by Vísir shows that aerial photographs taken of the area taken shortly after the war prove that this is not the case. Friðþór Eydal, an author interested in the activities of the British army during the war years, said in a statement to Vísir: “Mining had already begun here before the British started their construction of the Reykjavík airport.” The city of Reykjavík, according to Friðþór, had begun using the site for gravel in road construction before the British arrived. Much material for the construction of the Reykjavík airport came from Öskjuhlíð, the hillside now home to Perlan, and also Fífuhvammur in Kópavogur. There was indeed gravel from Rauðhólar utilised in the construction of the Reykjavík airport, but the British also took careful records of the amounts removed. According to Friðþór, the 95,000 cubic metres taken by the British army can’t account for the total damage done to the Rauðhólar area. Additionally, the new photographic evidence taken in 1946 still shows the area as largely in tact. The largest part of Rauðhólar then must have been taken after the war, by the city of Reykjavík itself. The area was mined for gravel up until 1961, when it was given protected status.      ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
479,Iceland Review,Use of Lodgepole Pine in Reforestation Sparks Feud Between Agencies,2022/11/10,"The coming merger of the Icelandic Forest Service and the Soil Conservation Service has led to a debate over the use of invasive species in reforestation and land reclamation work. Central to the debate between the two agencies is the place of the lodgepole pine, and whether it belongs in Icelandic forests. Pinus contorta, with the common name of lodgepole pine, is a species native to the West Coast of North America. It has been introduced into Icelandic forestry in an attempt to help with the reforestation of Iceland, but some warn against negative consequences of invasive species.   The Icelandic Forest Service, in their resolutions from the 2022 general meeting, recently condemned what they believed was a campaign against them by the Soil Conservation Service, which publicly critiqued the use of lodgepole pine in Icelandic reforestation attempts. In their resolutions, the Icelandic Forest Service stated that  “the campaign tries to discredit the ambitious and successful work that has been carried out in the most forest-deprived country in Europe and the seventh most forest-deprived country in the world, where natural forests grow on only 1.5% of the country and cultivated forests on only 0.5% of the area of the country. The cultivation of new forests is the most effective weapon in the fight against soil erosion and also one of the most cost-effective methods to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”   However, the Soil Conservation Service has rejected the suggestion that they have worked against the Icelandic Forest Service by critiquing the use of lodgepole pine. “The Soil Conservation Service has stated that the first choice for reforestation is Icelandic birch and that local varieties should be used if available,” said Árni Bragason, director of the Soil Conservation Service,in a statement to Fréttablaðið. “Birch has grown in Iceland for thousands of years and is adapted to the conditions here. However, we also know that birch is not necessarily the best tree for all uses.” Árni has also drawn comparisons with the lupine: “I hope that people will plan the cultivation of the lodgepole pine and its cultivation area so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes we made with the lupine.” Lupine is a flowering plant native to Alaska and is considered an invasive species by the Icelandic Institute of Natural History. Because the lupine is a type of legume, it helps fix nitrogen into the soil and was introduced in Iceland with the hope of aiding in land reclamation. Now, lupines are estimated to cover some 314 km² of Iceland, and some conservationists fear for its impact on native flora.   “Those who work in land reclamation and forestry of course must take responsibility [for the lupine]. Although we acted in good faith at the time, we did not foresee how invasive the species is,” Árni stated.
 Árni said he wants to encourage Jónatan Garðarsson, chairman of the Icelandic Forest Service, to present facts instead of repeating what are, in his opinion, empty claims. “It is good for everyone to know the facts and get out of the echo chamber […] because otherwise there is a risk that such misinformation will come to dominate the discussion.” Árni has also stated that he has used lodgepole pine as Christmas trees in the last years.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
480,Iceland Review,Bad Year for Eagle Nesting,2022/11/09,"Compared with previous years, 2022 has been a bad year for the eagle population in Iceland. In the summer, there were at least 58 known nesting pairs of eagles in Iceland, but of these, only 27 pairs produced some 38 chicks. Compared with 2021, some 45 nesting pairs produced 58 chicks. Specialists blame bad spring weather this year, as nesting success can be shown to worsen the further north the pair nested. Since 2019, GPS trackers have been used to trace the habitats and journeys of young eagles. In 2022, 14 fledgelings were outfitted with transmitters. Three of them died due to unknown causes, and others are still staying at their home nests through the winter when they will leave their nests. The young birds carry their transmitters for life, so over time scientists hope to map their journeys and how their routes change over time. Using this information, specialists hope to be able to better anticipate where to establish conservation areas and where to limit infrastructure, such as potential wind turbines. Nevertheless, Iceland’s eagle population has been doing well in recent years thanks to conservation efforts, with some 92 known eagles in just West Iceland, mostly nesting around Faxaflói. The monitoring is being conducted in cooperation between the University of Iceland, the West Iceland Nature Research Centre, and local people.

481,Iceland Review,Iceland Moves to Reduce Marine Bycatch in Light of New US Import Regulations,2022/11/09,"Icelandic regulators are making moves to conform to new regulations of seafood imports in the United States, according to the latest information from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. In an effort to promote more sustainable fishing practices among exporting nations, the US has announced the introduction of new regulations which limit the acceptable amount of marine bycatch produced by fishing. Originally announced in 2016 with a 5-year grace period for nations to conform to the new regulations, the implementation has been delayed in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving Icelandic fisheries extra time to meet the new rules. Especially important in the Icelandic context is the amount of seabirds and seals affected by lumpfish fishing, a fishery traditionally for small boat fishermen. Some Icelanders have expressed concerns that the new regulations will disproportionately affect small-scale rural fishermen, who are already suffering economically. According to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, Iceland has already launched measures in response to the new US regulations. Increased monitoring is being implemented, using ship logs, drones, and geospatial modelling to better understand the distribution of bycatch. In response to the poor state of the seal population in Iceland, the direct hunting of seals has been banned. It is now forbidden to shoot seals to scare them away from fish farms, for instance. Other methods are also being investigated to reduce bycatch, such as the use of sound repellents on fishing gear. By both increasing the monitoring of wild fishing stocks, and also increasingly monitoring registered bycatch, Icelandic authorities hope to gain a fuller picture of their success in implementing these changes. Another concern is that the relatively higher bycatch of smaller fisheries, such as lumpfish, could adversely affect the status of larger, more lucrative fisheries, such as cod. According to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, while it is certain that seafood from fisheries with bycatch in excess of US guidelines will be prevented from entering the market, there is as of yet no final word on how seafood from other fisheries will be handled. It is also as of yet unclear whether the steps taken by Icelandic authorities will be considered sufficient to meet the US conditions. The US regulations, after a delay, are now slated to come into effect on January 1, 2024.    ","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
482,Iceland Review,Regional Director of Marine Stewardship Council Warns Against Overfishing,2022/11/03,"In a recent Morgunblaðið editorial, Gísli Gíslason, regional director of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in the North Atlantic, has warned against the dangers of overfishing. “It’s time for someone to take the initiative and to lead the international community to an agreement. Everyone would benefit, including the fish stocks, marine ecosystem, fishing industry, and consumers,” Gísli said. The MSC is a UK-based international non-profit organisation, which sets standards for sustainable fishing. Its ecolabel is awarded to fisheries which follow its guidelines for sustainable fishing. Iceland has run afoul of MSC guidelines in the past, its lumpfish fishery having its MSC certification suspended during the first year of its validity for excessive bycatch in nets, including seabirds and seals. This small-boat fishery has since regained its certification after introducing necessary changes, including the closure of certain fishing areas, hunting bans, increased observation, and mandatory logbook registration. Such small-boat fishing is by nature on a smaller scale than the trawler fishing that takes place in deeper waters, the subject of Gísli’s statements. According to Gísli, 27% of fish stocks were reported as overfished in 2019, a marked increase from previous years. He specifically called on the coastal nations of the North Atlantic, including Norway, Iceland, Russia, Greenland and Denmark, and the UK to reach an agreement on cod, mackerel, and herring fishing, which he says are all being fished at levels above those recommended by experts. In his statement, he also pointed to the collapse of the Norwegian herring fishery in the 1960s as a model and warning for the present day.      ","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
483,Iceland Review,More Fish Escape from Aquaculture Pens in West Fjords,2022/11/02,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, or MAST, has recently been notified of a hole in a fish pen in Tálknafjörður in the West Fjords of Iceland. The pen in question is owned and operated by Arnarlax, an aquacultural concern in Iceland. The hole was discovered after a routine inspection and has since been repaired, according to MAST. According to information from Arnarlax, the hole in question was some 14cm large, occurring at a depth of 9m. The affected pen held around 99,000 salmon smolt (juvenile salmon). Since the hole was discovered, MAST has ordered an inspection of other pens in the fjord to ensure there are no further leaks. Aquaculture, the raising of penned fish instead of catching wild stock, has been a subject of debate in recent years in Iceland. Proponents of aquaculture point to how it relieves pressure from wild fish stocks. Icelandic fisheries have had to implement a quota system in order to ensure against over-fishing of wild populations. Some see aquaculture as a viable alternative to supply a high-demand market, such as salmon, without over-fishing the wild stock. However, environmentalists have criticized the practice of aquaculture, saying that high-density fish farming pollutes once-pristine fjords. Another significant concern, as shown by recent events, is that fish pens often break through wear and tear, releasing their bred stock into the wild. The effect of interbreeding between wild and captive fish populations is not yet understood, and escaped fish also put additional pressure on the wild population, competing with them for food and other resources.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

The quake and its aftershocks were detected in Akureyri. Additionally, an earthquake swarm was detected at Herðubreið, in the Vatnajökull highland, the largest quakes measuring up to magnitude 3.0. Since October 22, some 3,600 earthquakes have been registered near Herðubreið. The most powerful so far has been a magnitude 4.1, the most significant activity since measuring began near Herðubreið in 1991. Though some several hundred kilometers apart, the Grímsey quakes, a part of the Tjörnes fracture zone, and the latest earthquake swarm near Herðubreið are a part of the same system, resting along the plate boundary in North Iceland. Herðubreið is also significant for its proximity to Askja, a major volcano system in Iceland whose 1875 eruption caused significant damage to agriculture. Herðubreið mountain is situated within the Ódáðahraun lava field, Iceland’s largest contiguous lava field totaling 4,400 km² (1,699 mi²).

485,Iceland Review,US Extends Deadline for Marine Mammal Bycatch Regulations,2022/10/26,"In a recent announcement, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has extended the deadline for the implementation of regulations governing the import of seafood to the US. Aimed at protecting endangered species and limiting the amount of unnecessary bycatch (what is unintentionally caught by net fishing, which can include seabirds, other species of fish, seals, dolphins, and even small whales), the regulations aim to limit the import of marine products from fisheries where marine mammals are caught. This has potentially large consequences for Iceland, the US being a major export market for Icelandic seafood. The regulations were originally introduced in 2016 and gave exporting nations a 5-year period to comply with the new US regulations. However, this grace period was extended by a year, and then further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, Iceland lost its Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification in 2018 due to the large number of bycatch produced by Icelandic lumpfish fishing. Lumpfish generally stick near the shore and are thus safe from larger trawlers. This fish, prized for its roe, is still fished in small boats with nets. However, net fishing also produces large amounts of unwanted bycatch. Although Iceland has taken steps in recent years to minimizing the environmental impact of net fishing, it is a complicated situation for Icelandic fishermen, as it is generally the small boat fishermen who will be under the most pressure from the current regulations. Iceland’s small boat fishermen have already been sidelined in many ways by the current quota system. Although the bycatch problem is indeed important, it leaves some wondering if the burden of environmental responsibility is being placed excessively on small, independent fishermen.    ","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
486,Iceland Review,"Anglers Caught Over 45,000 Salmon in Icelandic Rivers This Year",2022/10/22,"A record 45,300 salmon were caught by anglers in Iceland this year. New figures issued by the Marine and Freshwater Institute (MFI) show that this year’s catch is 8.5% higher than the average catch in Iceland for the last 48 years, or since 1974. Fishermen caught around 8,800 more salmon in Icelandic rivers this year than they did in 2021. Several factors have likely contributed to the increase in this year’s salmon catch. For one, smolt stocking programs have supplemented the natural production of Icelandic rivers. Some fish are also counted more than once because they’re caught more than once; anglers will often release salmon back into the rivers once they’ve caught them. Overall, this year’s salmon catch was higher in all regions of the country except the Westfjords. See Also: Record number of pink salmon caught in 2021 Wild salmon catches have been down over the last seven years, hitting a low in 2019, when around 24,000 wild salmon were caught. This summer, however, 27,800 wild salmon were caught, which marks a 21.7% increase over last year. The number of salmon that will migrate in a given year depends on the success of a whole generation of fish: how many smolt migrate from rivers to the sea, then survive adulthood in the ocean and return to spawn. There’s been an increase in the number of salmon dying in the North Atlantic, although MFI says the exact reason for this is not known. Several explanations have been offered as possibilities, however, including climate change, bycatch, the impact of fish farming, and changes in freshwater habitats.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
487,Iceland Review,New Study Shows Large Hole in Arctic Ozone Layer,2022/10/19,"A major research expedition has recently shed new light on the extent to which the arctic ozone layer has been depleted. The MOSAiC program, then the largest research expedition ever of the Arctic Ocean, set off in September 2019. Hundreds of scientists representing some twenty nations were involved with the project. Central to the project was the German ice breaker “Polarstern,” or Polar Star, which was left adrift in polar ice for a year. Instruments aboard the vessel took atmospheric measurements, and the results of the study are now being discussed at the Arctic Round Table. A key finding in the study was that even after the international banning of ozone-harming substances, the largest hole ever found in the ozone was detected over the Arctic at an altitude of some 20km. Dr. Markus Rex, a German researcher at the University of Potsdam, stated that: “the ozone layer is not improving. Things are getting worse in the Arctic. Now we understand that it is because the decomposers from the gas are still present in the atmosphere. Climate change makes them more aggressive: it’s bad news for the future of the ozone layer in the Arctic.” Nevertheless, there is some occasion for hope. Dr. Markus Rex continued: “We saw that under the ice the sea reaches a freezing point down to a depth of 14 meters in the winter. There is a healthy base for winter ice formation, and we believe we are still in a position to save the ice if we stop global warming. It responds very linearly to warming, and if we stop the warming, the melting of the ice will stop. That is good. This puts a lot of responsibility on our shoulders. We are the last generation that can save the sea ice in the Arctic.”  Read more about the MOSAiC expedition here.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
488,Iceland Review,Record Numbers of Pink Salmon Caught in Norway Have Icelanders Bracing for Invasion,2022/10/19,"Record numbers of pink salmon, an invasive species, have been caught in Norwegian rivers this year, leaving some Icelandic fisherman worried for a potential wave of the invasive fish. From 2017 to 2019, some 6 – 7,000 pink salmon have been caught in Norwegian rivers. However, this last year a record 200,000 were caught, 90% of which in the northern region of Finnmark. The invasive species is known to originate from Russia, where fish farms have been established in the White Sea, off of the Kola peninsula. There are estimated to be around 1 million pink salmon off the coast of of Norway, with around 550 thousand wild salmon. Records have also been recently been broken in Iceland, with some 339 pink salmon being caught in the summer of 2021. In the spring of 2022, juveniles were found in three rivers in the southwestern part of Iceland, including Botnsá in Hvalfjörður, Langá á Mýrum and the Grímsár-Hvítár confluence in Borgarfjörður. Pink salmon have been a known presence in Icelandic rivers since the first one was caught in 1960. Pink salmon are now seen all throughout Northern Europe, from the British Isles to Norway. Conservationists are concerned that the species may disrupt native habitats and compete with native stocks for food.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

Significant earthquakes were recorded under Mýrdalsjökull this Sunday, October 16. The largest of the recent quakes was measured at 3.8M. Because of this increased activity, Katla, one of Iceland’s most dangerous volcano systems, was placed under special monitoring and trips to the region were temporarily suspended. Notably, this affected many ice cave tourist trips. Increased seismic activity meant both an increased chance of glacial flooding and also potential exposure to volcanic gases.

490,Iceland Review,Ptarmigan Quota Increased for Upcoming Hunting Season,2022/10/18,"The Ministry of the Environment, Energy, and Climate has announced that the annual ptarmigan hunting season will begin on November 1 and conclude on December 4. This year’s hunting quota has been set at 26,000 birds, an increase of 6,000 from last year. Rock ptarmigan are still hunted in Iceland as they are considered a delicacy, often consumed on Christmas Eve. The Icelandic Institute of Natural History claims the preservation status the ptarmigan gained in 2003 has helped to significantly restore numbers. In May, the institute reported that the ptarmigan population was nearing its zenith in West and Northwest Iceland in the Westfjords while the population was likely declining in Northeast and East Iceland. In August, the institute reported poor recruitment in Northeast and West Iceland. The total ptarmigan population was estimated at just under 300,000 birds. Yesterday, Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Minister for the Environment, Energy, and Climate, announced the arrangement of this year’s ptarmigan hunting season. An announcement on the government’s website stated that hunting season shall last from November 1 to December 4, between 12 noon and sunset, from Tuesdays to Fridays. This year’s arrangement is similar to last year’s, with the exception that the quota has been increased to 26,000 birds, an increase of 6,000. Guðlaugur Þór also asked hunters to show moderation in light of the recruitment failure in Northeast and West Iceland: poor weather conditions this spring and summer are the likely explanation. The minister further encouraged hunters to refrain from hunting in large numbers in Northeast Iceland. Lastly, the announcement iterates the ban on ptarmigan sales, which applies equally to the sale of ptarmigan to resellers and others. “I’ve emphasised that the Environment Agency of Iceland should expedite the creation of a management and protection plan for the ptarmigan and that the arrangement of hunting season should based on that plan in the future,” the press release reads. The statement adds that a timeline for the management and protection plan, which involves a high level of cooperation with interested parties, has been established and that the plan would likely be introduced in May of 2023.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

Glacial flooding from this volcano system is a regular event on Iceland’s south coast, and the most recent round of floods has not caused any significant damage to infrastructure. Since last night, several earthquakes have been registered at Grímsvötn, but the Meteorological Office reports that there is no significant increase in seismic activity or threat of eruption. In total, the ice sheet has sunk some 15m, indicating the volume displaced by the flooding. At its peak, the flow from the glacier reached 500m³/s, a level that is not considered to pose any significant risk to the region. Travellers to the south coast may, however, have noticed swollen rivers over the weekend. Grímsvötn is one of Iceland’s most active volcano systems, with eruption cycles average 5-10 years.

The ice sheet has been measured as receding in the last few days, accompanied by increased seismic activity. Grímsvötn, one of Iceland’s most active volcanoes, has an eruption cycle of 5-10 years. As its last eruption was in 2011, it could mean that it is due soon. Glacial flooding can also trigger subglacial eruptions, which has been known to happen at Grímsvötn. The glacial flooding is expected to last for several days, but no structural damage is expected.

The new recommendation replaces the previous, more optimistic, recommendation which was based on numbers of immature capelin from 2021. Now, new data is available from the research ships Árni Friðriksson and Tarajoq, which took echo measurements of the capelin population between Iceland and Greenland between August 27 and September 29. The total population was estimated to be 1.1 million tonnes, with a spawning stock of around 763,000 tonnes. Some fishermen are nevertheless optimistic, as many years have been entirely without capelin. Of the past 13 years, 7 have seen no initial capelin quota issued. Although the lowered quota has been a disappointment for fishermen, if favourable market prices prevail, the capelin catch could still net ISK 30-35 billion. However, the quota is still subject to revision and will be updated after new figures are available in January and February of 2023. In an interview with RÚV, Gunnþór Ingvason, director of the Neskaupstaður herring processing plant, stated that “the problem is this uncertainty.

The project has monitored some 110 nests, including whimbrel and plover. Laying dates and hatching success were recorded as part of University of Iceland’s ongoing monitoring of these species. Because eggs change in density during the embryonic development, researchers are able to estimate the day of hatching with a high degree of accuracy. Once the chicks hatched, the parents were marked and measured with coloured rings. Chicks were monitored and measured every 3 days. However, researchers have to wait until the chicks develop before also tagging them with rings, as their legs must be long enough to not interfere with their mobility. Stool samples were also collected from the hatchlings to monitor their diet to better understand the relationship between food resources and chick development. A particular interest in the study was the role of crowberries in hatchling diets. The berries were measured every 3 days, and estimates for the total fruit biomass available to the developing chicks were calculated. In addition to traditional monitoring techniques, the study also employed GPS tagging to monitor their migrations patterns. Yes! Like adults they fly nonstop to West Africa!

Signs indicate that the salmon originate from open sea farms by Haganes, where a hole in the pen caused part of the stock to escape in August of 2021. MAST reports that it will re-run the original DNA analysis to confirm its finding, and that they hope to trace the origin of the farmed salmon in better detail. Of a sample of 32 salmon caught in the Mjólká river, 16 of them likely originated from farms. The other 16 were confirmed to be wild in origin. The farm in question is owned and operated by Icelandic aquacultural company Arnarlax. In a statement to RÚV, Karl Steinar Óskarsson, head of MAST’s aquaculture department, stated that “we always take it seriously when there’s a hole in a pen. No diseases have been found in the farmed salmon caught in Mjólká. It’s pretty clear that this fish has escaped. As soon as we have all the facts, we will update this information.” Escaped farm salmon can pose a risk to local, wild stocks, as aquaculture farms can be breeding grounds for diseases not found in wild salmon. Should farm-raised salmon escape and breed with the wild stock, it could cause larger problems for the local ecosystem.

505,Iceland Review,Ministry Dismisses Efling’s Complaint Against State Mediator,2023/02/03,"The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour has dismissed Efling’s administrative complaint against the State Mediator’s mediating proposal, RÚV reports. The Ministry believes that the matter is “not an administrative decision that may be appealed to a higher authority.” In what is expected to be a big day, both the Labour Court and the District Court of Reykjavík will be hearing cases related to the ongoing dispute between Efling, the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise, and the state mediator today. In an announcement on its website at the end of January, Efling stated that it had filed an administrative complaint against the state mediator’s mediating proposal to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour. The union demanded that the mediating proposal be repealed as there was a lack of consultation, validity, proportionality, and equality. Efling added that the state mediator was incompetent and could not be considered impartial in the dispute. On the union’s website yesterday, Efling announced that it had further submitted a request for annulment to the Reykjavík District Court. The reason: a lack of reaction from Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, Minister of Social Affairs and Labour, to Efling’s administrative complaint. This morning, however, the ministry announced that it had decided to dismiss Efling’s complaint. In the opinion of the Ministry, the mediating proposal, according to Article 27 of the Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, is part of the work of the state mediator and part of the procedure that aims to resolve a labor dispute between the parties. In contrast, paragraph 2 of Article 1 of administrative law states that the law applies when the government, including administrative committees, make decisions about “people’s rights or obligations.” “Decisions on procedure and decisions that have a general legal effect are, therefore, not considered decisions on the rights or obligations of people in this regard,” the verdict reads. As noted by Vísir, today marks a “big day” in the dispute between Efling and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA), on the one hand, and in the dispute between Efling and the state mediator, on the other. Hearings will take place today in the Reykjavík District Court in the dispute between Efling and the state mediator (the mediator has requested Efling’s electoral roll in order to put the mediating proposal to a vote among Efling members). The Labour Court will also begin hearings in the dispute between Efling and SA this afternoon; SA has requested that the court rule whether or not Efling union members are allowed to go through with their planned strikes on Tuesday – while the state mediator’s proposal remains on the table.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
506,Iceland Review,"Minister Unauthorised to Sell Surveillance Aircraft, MP Says",2023/02/03,"There is no authorisation in the state budget for the sale of TF-SIF, the Coast Guard’s surveillance aircraft, the Chair of the Budget Committee told RÚV yesterday. The Minister of Justice has stated that his decision to discontinue the operations of TF-SIF was made in consultation with the Coast Guard. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, Bjarkey Olsen Gunnarsdóttir, MP for the Left-Greens and Chair of the Budget Committee, stated that Justice Minister Jón Gunnarsson did not have the authorisation for the sale of TF-SIF, the Coast Guard’s only surveillance aircraft. According to Bjarkey, the budget authorises the purchase, or lease, of three rescue helicopters and the sale of an older helicopter, TF-LÍF. Bjarkey added that she was unhappy with the decision and the way that the Minister had gone about things, not least in light of the fact that no discussion had taken place within the Budget Committee. “Authorisation is required, according to the sixth article of the law, in order to be allowed to sell these machines, and we may have reacted in a different way if we assumed that they were being sold – in discussions within the budget committee and discussions within Parliament – so I am not at all happy that some kind of authorisation is being requested afterwards, when the minister should do it beforehand,” Bjarkey remarked. When asked if a minister could set a plan in motion without the required authorisation, as in this case, Bjarkey stated that such a thing was possible: “but of course, those plans may also collapse if the authorisation is not obtained; that’s the nature of these things.” Bjarkey planned to convene the Budget Committee to discuss the matter yesterday and that she would request the presence of the Minister of Justice and the Coast Guard. Speaking to RÚV, the Minister of Justice maintained that the decision to discontinue the operations of TF-SIF was made in consultation with the Coast Guard. “We received a letter on December 18, in which various options to respond to the operational deficit were reviewed. It was believed that this would be the least damaging way forward, in terms of security considerations and other aspects of the Coast Guard’ operation, and would serve to fill the budgetary gap,” Jón Gunnarsson observed. Preparations have begun to examine possible replacements for TF-SIF in the event of the sale. Jón stated that authorisation from Parliament to sell the plane has yet to be sought. “In other words, the intention was to announce that preparations would be started within the Coast Guard to sell the aircraft. We must then receive the authorisation from Parliament in order to carry out that sale. Meanwhile, we plan to have worked on future solutions in this regard, where we do not compromise the underlying security considerations,” Jón remarked. He added that it must be considered food for thought that the plane had never been recalled from missions in the southern seas over the recent years. Kristín Jónsdóttir, geologist and Head of the Icelandic Meteorological Office’s Service and Research Department, told RÚV that the proposed sale was a big disappointment. “Because we’re talking about an aircraft that can help us in big moments. We are talking about critical events, such as the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. The aircraft penetrates plumes of smoke and is capable of observing phenomena that can’t be detected with the naked eye. There will be volcanic eruptions in the future where we need this aircraft.” The State Auditor’s report from last year also noted that the aircraft was particularly important at the outer limits of Iceland’s jurisdiction, RÚV reports. In such areas, searching for, and rescuing people from danger was only possible by way of planes or ships. The report also made mention of the plane’s unique features, that it is equipped with advanced radars and a thermal camera. Lifeboats can also be launched from TF-SIFT for those in distress. Yesterday morning, temperatures ran high among members of Parliament, RÚV notes, who expressed their displeasure with the Minister of Justice’s decision. The MPs unceremoniously broached the issue during discussions about the Speaker’s meeting management and complained that the decision had not been discussed much earlier. “It’s unacceptable that the government’s fiscal policy leads to basic infrastructure, essential safety equipment, being sold so that other operations can be maintained,” Helga Vala Helgadóttir, MP for the Social Democratic Alliance, observed. Björn Leví Gunnarsson, MP for the Pirates, was likewise dissatisfied with the minister’s actions. “Was any MP present aware, when voting for the budget bill occurrred, that it would have these consequences? We don’t know what we’re agreeing to when we press the button because it’s not explicit.” “It’s been observed how important the aircraft is, both for the safety of the citizens and for the Coast Guard’s security role: for search and rescue,” Sigmar Guðmundsson, MP for the Liberal Reform Party, commented. “It is quite unbelievable that the ruling parties did not discuss the matter with us.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
507,Iceland Review,Amnesty Report: Iceland “Vastly Overusing” Solitary Confinement,2023/02/02,"Iceland is “vastly overusing” solitary confinement in pre-trial detention a new report released by Amnesty International finds. The Director of the Icelandic Association of Betterment agrees with the report’s findings. On Tuesday, Amnesty International – an international non-governmental organisation focused on human rights – released a report on the harmful and unjustified use of pre-trial solitary confinement in Iceland. The report, which is based on research and interviews with experts from across the justice system, along with individuals who have been subjected to solitary confinement, finds that “Iceland routinely applies solitary confinement for prolonged periods and even to people with pre-existing vulnerabilities, such as children and people with disabilities that would be exacerbated by solitary confinement.” “Data obtained by Amnesty International shows that over the 10 years between 2012 and 2021, 825 individuals were placed in pre-trial solitary confinement in Iceland. Of these, 10 were aged between 15 and 17. In a small country with low rates of imprisonment generally, and pre-trial detention specifically, these figures are troubling,” the report notes. The authors of the report state that solitary confinement is inherently problematic as far as the potential for human rights violations is concerned. International standards dictate that solitary confinement should be used only in the most exceptional cases and should always be subject to rigorous scrutiny. “Any use of solitary confinement can amount to torture,” the report notes. Guðmundur Ingi Þóroddsson, chairman of Afstaða, the Icelandic Association of Betterment, agrees with the reports’ assessment. “We’ve seen devastating examples of how this affects people, even for a short period of time; some people don’t recover,” Guðmundur told RÚV this week. Guðmundur, who has himself spent time in solitary confinement, stated that isolation amounted to nothing less than torture and that people often break on the first day. “And it’s used on people who are mentally disabled or impaired, who face different kinds of problems, where this kind of detention only serves to exacerbate these problems, until they become completely out of control, and that’s what we’re seeing today. We have individuals in the system today who are worse off from being placed in isolation. But it is also because there are no other resources available in this country,” Guðmundur added. One of the aims of Amnesty’s report is to catalyse a revision to the current legislation. The report concludes with a series of recommendations that the organisation urges the government to take.

508,Iceland Review,Efling Chair Demands Meeting with Prime Minister,2023/02/02,"The Chair of the Efling Union has requested a meeting with the Prime Minister following the latter’s comments on the state mediator’s mediating proposal, Vísir reports. As the courts review the legality of Efling’s first round of strikes, the union expects to vote on further strike action tomorrow. Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, Chair of the Efling Union, has requested a meeting with PM Katín Jakobsdóttir regarding the latter’s comments on the state mediator’s mediating proposal (i.e. miðlunartillaga); following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Katrín stated that she believed the mediator’s proposal passes scrutiny: “It’s clear that this mediation proposal has been submitted. I’m not in a position to assess its legality exactly, but as far as I see it, and according to the experts with which I’ve consulted, it passes scrutiny,” Katrín observed. Sólveig subsequently sent a letter to the PM where she requested that Katrín share the advice of the experts in question so that Efling could take that advice into account. In a post on Facebook yesterday morning, Sólveig Anna stated that she had still not received an answer from the PM. According to information from the Prime Minister’s Office, upon request from Vísir, the letter will be answered, although further detail was not provided. The Efling Union’s strike at the Íslandshotel hotels will, barring any change, commence on Tuesday. Iceland’s Labour Court has yet to rule on the legality of the strike, however, with the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA) having deemed it inadmissible to start strike action before votes have been cast on the mediator’s proposal. The Labour Court is expected to begin hearing the case on Friday. One expert believes that the court will rule that the strikes are illegal. As noted by Vísir, there will be some time before votes are cast on the state mediator’s proposal as the mediator is still waiting for Efling’s electoral roll to be delivered; the union has refused to hand over the electoral roll as it deems the mediator’s proposal illegal. The Reykjavík District Court is currently reviewing the legality of the proposal. In the meantime, Efling has called for further strike action. Voting on further strikes is set to begin at noon tomorrow. The strikes consist of temporary work stoppages by Efling members at Olíudreifing, Skeljungur, Samskip, Berjaya hotels (formerly Icelandair hotels), and the Edition hotel. As noted by Vísir, Skeljungur handles the transportation of fuel to the Reykjavík Airport; a disruption could affect domestic flights, but how soon depends, among other things, on the inventory status at the field. According to information from Icelandair, the matter is being examined and the situation analysed in cooperation with the fire department. A strike at Olíudreifing could have a major impact on the public given that the transport of fuel to gas stations in the capital area would come to a halt. According to information from Olíudreifing, gas tanks at stations could be empty in a few days. But how quickly that happens depends, among other things, on the stock level and whether consumers would begin hoarding gasoline before that time.  ",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
509,Iceland Review,"Efling Chair Demands Labour Market MP Intercede, Withdraw State Mediator’s Proposal",2023/01/29,"Efling Chair Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir is urging Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, Minister of Social Affairs and the Labour Market, to intercede in the labour union’s ongoing dispute with the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA) and withdraw the mediation proposal that state mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson issued at the end of last week. Sólveig Anna also wants Aðalsteinn to withdraw from the negotiation process entirely. RÚV reports. See Also: State Mediator’s Proposal Meets with Criticism from Efling and SA The proposal, which was issued in the wake of an “unprecedented” and extremely contentious round of negotiations, essentially consists of the same terms that SA has agreed upon with other unions. Under normal circumstances, this proposal would be put to a vote among Efling’s members. Sólveig Anna has repeatedly described it as bad for workers, however, and as such has withheld the union’s electoral roll as a way of stalling the process and preventing a vote from taking place. Aðalsteinn demanded that the electoral roll be handed over and referred the matter to the Reykjavík District Court, which will review the case on Monday morning. In the meantime, Efling members have voted on whether the employees of Íslandshótel will strike. The results of this vote will be announced on Monday evening. ‘The situation the state mediator has created is intolerable’ In a post on her Facebook page on Saturday afternoon, Sólveig Anna said “the situation the state mediator has created with his conduct is intolerable,” and “will not be borne.” She then published the letter she sent to Guðmundur Ingi that same day, in which she pointed out that it is the Labour Minister who is responsible for appointing the state mediator and demanded a meeting to discuss the Minister’s intercession in the dispute prior to both the court hearing and Efling’s strike announcement. “I emphasize to you that this is a grave and precedential matter that revolves around the legitimacy of institutions of entities within the labour market, the fundamental rights of workers, and the trust that working people will have in the official framework of labour market issues in the future,” Sólveig Anna wrote in her letter. “I ask you not to underestimate the weight that the Efling labour union will put on the response to this issue and, depending on the circumstances, will direct at those institutions in the public sector that are responsible for it. I therefore appeal to you in your responsibility as Minister of the Labour Market to comply with my request for a meeting without delay.” As of Sunday morning, Sólveig Anna had not received a response from the Minister but told reporters that she wants Guðmundur Ingi to push for the state mediator’s proposal to be withdrawn. Asked if she also wants the Minister to remove Aðalsteinn Leifsson from his role as state mediator, Sólveig Anna replied that Efling’s leadership has already expressed its lack of confidence in Aðalsteinn as a mediator. “I think it’s obvious at this stage, given how he’s acted toward us, that he can’t be a party to the dispute we’re now in.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
510,Iceland Review,State Mediator Not Fearful of Losing Unions’ Trust,2023/01/27,"The state mediator does not fear that he has lost the trust of the unions, despite the reaction to his mediating proposal in the dispute between the Efling Union and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA), RÚV reports. The proposal was submitted as a result of unprecedentedly tough negotiations. State mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson does not fear that his mediation proposal in the dispute between the Efling Union and SA may have permanently damaged the office’s relationship with the unions – despite the recent condemnations. “I listen to the comments that are made about my work, but I reiterate my point that I submitted this proposal after careful consideration,” Aðalsteinn told RÚV today. The proposal puts the same agreement that SA previously agreed upon by other unions to a vote among members of Efling. Efling’s Chair, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, has repeatedly described it as bad for workers. In order for the state mediator to oversee the vote, he needs an electoral roll (a list of Efling members eligible to vote) – which Efling’s Chair does not intend to hand over. “By refusing to hand over the electoral roll, Efling is standing in the way of members being able to vote on the proposal. If we do not receive the list, we must explore alternative options,” Aðalsteinn stated. When Aðalsteinn presented his proposal at a press conference yesterday, he stated that the reason for the proposal was the “unprecedented situation” that had arisen in the negotiations. As noted by RÚV, however, strikes have been employed throughout the years without any attempt to avert them with a mediating proposal. According to Aðalsteinn, what makes the situation “unprecedented” is not the prospect of strikes, but because of the “unprecedented” nature of the negotiations. “This dispute stands out in that it has been extremely difficult to get any kind of conversation about possible solutions going,” he concluded.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
511,Iceland Review,Police Association Welcomes Authority to Employ Stun Guns,2023/01/27,"The Police Association of Iceland welcomes the Justice Minister’s decision to authorise the use of electroshock weapons. An article on Vísir this morning notes that there is no scientific consensus on the lethality of such weapons. In an announcement on the Police Association of Iceland’s website yesterday, the association welcomed Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson’s decision to authorise the use of electroshock weapons. The association stated that it had, for years, emphasised the need to better ensure the safety of police officers. The decision was, therefore, a cause for celebration that the Minister had shown an understanding of the interests of police officers. “Accidents at work occur most frequently within the police profession, and it is common for a police officer to be alone on the scene and have to deal with challenging and unforeseen situations where further assistance is not always at hand.” The Minister’s decision helps to clarify the authority of the police, contributing to increased security for police officers and, at the same time, “increased security for ordinary citizens,” the announcement reads. The minister’s decision to authorise the use of electroshock weapons has proven somewhat controversial, with PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir stating that she had wished that the new regulation had received a more thorough discussion within Parliament. An article published on Vísir this morning notes that there is no consensus among experts on the lethality of these weapons. The reporter notes that the reason is twofold: first, scientific ethics make research impossible, and second, cause of death has proven difficult to disentangle following the employment of stun guns. “According to an extensive report conducted by Reuters from 2017,” the article notes, “over a thousand people died as a result of the employment of stun guns in the United States over a period of approximately fifteen years. In nine out of ten cases, the person was unarmed.” “Reuters reporters reviewed 712 autopsy reports in connection with their investigation. In 153 cases, forensic pathologists concluded that the shot from the stun gun had been the cause or one of the causes of the person’s death. When the stun gun was not considered a factor, the cause of death was usually attributed to heart disease or other illness, drug use, or an accident.” The article also notes that independent studies have “shown that stun guns can be useful in reducing injuries to police and those on whom the guns are used.” These weapons should be “relatively safe” when they are applied in the right way, that is to say, when directed towards the right area of the body and when the electric shocks last for a short duration.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
512,Iceland Review,State Mediator’s Proposal Meets With Criticism from Efling and SA,2023/01/27,"State mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson presented his mediation proposal in the wage dispute between Efling and SA at a press conference yesterday. The proposal met with criticism from both SA and the Efling Union. The state mediator believes that he is well within his legal rights. Yesterday, State mediator Aðalsteinn Leifsson presented a special mediating proposal (i.e. miðlunartillaga) to resolve the dispute between the Efling Union and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA). Negotiations between the two parties have devolved into a sort of Gordian knot, with the last meeting between Efling and SA lasting only a minute. The proposal means that members of the Efling union will have to vote on the same contract previously agreed upon by other unions. Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, Chair of Efling, told RÚV yesterday that she believed the state mediator had broken the law with his proposal: he had not consulted with Efling. Halldór Benjamín Þorbergsson, Director of SA, struck a similar note, arguing that it was “the right of the disputing parties” to bring the case to a conclusion. Following the response from Efling and SA, Aðalsteinn sent out a press release yesterday in which he rejected any claims about the illegality of the proposal. A mediating proposal was one of the resources available to the state mediator to try to ensure peace in the labour market. “Given the state of the dispute between SA and Efling, it was my assessment, the office’s assessment, that it was inevitable to try this remedy.” Aðalsteinn admitted that the labour legislation imposes the duty on the state mediator to consult with the parties to a wage dispute before submitting such a proposal: this applies to the content of the proposal and the procedure for voting. “And that’s why I called representatives of both parties to a meeting with me today for this purpose. I discussed it with them before the proposal was made public. This obligation to consult the parties, however, does not imply that they have the right to intervene or veto the proposal.” As noted by RÚV, Aðalsteinn denies that the way in which the proposal was presented was illegal in any way. When asked if the parties to a dispute should be familiar with the content of the legislation, he replied that the law was very clear as regards the authorisation of a mediating proposal. “It is also very clear in the labour legislation that when a mediation proposal has been submitted, a vote must take place.” Sólveig Anna went on to describe the proposal as a “monstrosity” (i.e. óskapnaður) that failed to mediate anything. Efling’s point of view had not been taken into account: the state mediator was simply imposing SA’s offer on the Efling Union. Aðalsteinn replied that this was far from the case. He was not proposing an agreement from SA but rather one that the Federation of General and Special workers in Iceland (SGS) had negotiated with SA. “After very difficult and demanding wage negotiations – where an agreement was struck. This agreement has since been approved by an overwhelming majority of votes in all of the eighteen unions within SGS. It should also be noted that this agreement includes the highest proportional increases that have been settled in this round of wage negotiations, within the general labour market, over the past weeks and months.” At the time of writing, the Efling union had not submitted its membership list to the state mediator; the deadline was 8 PM yesterday. As noted by RÚV, Efling is thereby shirking its statutory duty, given that the office of the state mediator has the right to receive the membership list. Elísabet S. Ólafsdóttir, Chief of Staff at the State Mediator’ office, told RÚV yesterday that the office would have to consider its next steps: “At this stage, we can send Efling another notice. If the notice proves ineffective, it may eventually be necessary to obtain a ruling from the district court to force delivery.” The proposal will be put to a vote by the members of Efling and voting will begin at 12 noon on Saturday and continue until 5 PM on Tuesday.

As Efling members began to vote on strike action, the state mediator invited Efling’s negotiating committee back to the negotiating table alongside the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA) today. The meeting did not go well, lasting “all of about a minute,” according to RÚV. In an interview following the meeting, Halldór Benjamín Þorbergsson, Chair of SA, told RÚV that Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, Chair of the Efling Union, was preventing agreements from being reached, and by calling a strike – forfeiting the possibility of retroactive wage agreements. The Deep North Podcast: Wage Negotiations “With the intransigence that she displayed today, Sólveig Anna is preventing union members from contractual wage improvements,” Halldór remarked. Sólveig Anna responded bluntly to SA’s criticism. “Do people really think it’s normal, acceptable, that while you can criticise the dress code and behaviour of Efling members, you can’t pay those same people, who produce the profits, which find their way into other people’s pockets, decent wages?” Sólveig Anna iterated her conviction that Efling members were prepared to go on strike in order to push for decent wages. “It is a characteristic of civilised societies that people can provide for themselves with the work they do. In the case of many Efling members, this is simply not the case. I find it disgusting. Unacceptable. And we are fighting for this to be changed,” Sólveig Anna told RÚV.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
514,Iceland Review,Government Signs Agreement to Bolster Elite Sports in Iceland,2023/01/24,"This weekend, the government signed an agreement with the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (ÍSÍ) on the formulation of policy concerning elite sports. Former Olympian and coach Vésteinn Hafsteinsson has been hired to oversee the project. During a press conference in Gothenburg, Sweden, last Saturday, January 21, the Ministry of Education and Children’s Affairs and the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland signed an agreement on the formulation of policy concerning elite sports in Iceland. As part of the agreement, Vésteinn Hafsteinsson – former Olympic athlete and coach – will relocate to Iceland to collaborate with the government to formulate measures on how best to improve the status and rights of elite athletes in Iceland. Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðason has also appointed a special working group comprised of interested parties to collaborate on the project, which Vésteinn Hafsteinsson will lead. The aim is to create “the best possible framework for elite sports in Iceland” and to put “high-performance athletes on equal footing with their competitors on an international level.” The government’s press release notes that Vésteinn, as a coach and former top-ranked discus thrower, is “familiar with the conditions required to shape and sustain elite athletic performance.” Last year, Vésteinn was chosen Coach of the Year in Sweden, having helped Swedish discus throwers Daniel Stahl and Simon Pettersson secure gold and silver medals respectively at the Tokyo Olympics. Vésteinn has been involved in a wide variety of sports over the years, both in Iceland and abroad, and “knows the environment and the athletes well.” Vésteinn has been hired for the next five years to formulate policy changes with the government and, in the future, follow up on the implementation of this policy in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Children’s Affairs and ÍSÍ. Vésteinn will also assume the role of ÍSÍ’s Performance Manager where he will, among other things, supervise ÍSÍ’s Achievement Strategy (Afreksstefnu) and aid Icelandic competitors in preparation for the Olympics. “It is very pleasing to cooperate with Vésteinn on this important project,” Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Education and Children’s Affairs, stated at the press conference. “Elite athletes are role models. They inspire and motivate us. They prove that we can achieve excellent results, despite our smallness. This initiative will serve to strengthen sports across the board, while at the same time stimulating recreation and solidarity. Our top athletes do not enjoy the same support as their foreign counterparts. Nor do they have access to the same facilities. They also do not enjoy the same civil liberties as the rest of us. This needs to be fixed. With a new national stadium, we improve our facilities. And now begins a review of our entire framework for elite sports in Iceland as stipulated in the government agreement.” As noted on the government’s website, the aim of the work, going forward, is to review and propose changes to the framework, legislation, and other aspects deemed necessary to provide support for elite athletes in Iceland. The working group is tasked with examining, in particular, the cost of participation in national-team activities for competitors and their families, as well as examining the civil liberties of accomplished athletes within the state’s different social support systems.","Politics,Sport",0,0,0,1,0,1
515,Iceland Review,Sólveig Anna Confident That Strikes Will Be Approved,2023/01/24,"300 employees at Íslandshótel hotels are set to go on strike if action is approved by the Efling union. Efling’s Chairperson is confident that the strike will be approved. Tourism advocates are surprised that the strikes are being directed towards a single employer, RÚV reports. Efling union members will begin voting on strike action today. If the first wave of action is approved, three hundred employees of Íslandshótel hotels (i.e. custodial staff) will go on strike. Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, Chairperson of Efling, told RÚV yesterday that, based on conversations with hotel workers, she expected union members to approve strike action. “A strike notice has been accepted, and voting will begin tomorrow at noon. The strike action applies to union members employed by Íslandshótel hotels. These are approximately three hundred people, custodial staff, who have the opportunity to vote on whether they are prepared to strike in order to push for better contracts: Efling contracts for Efling people.” “And you expect union members to approve of the action?” a reporter with RÚV inquired. “Yes, I expect that the action will be met with approval. The results of a very extensive wage survey conducted by Efling indicate that a very large group of Efling members are prepared to quit their jobs to fight for better conditions. Representatives from our negotiating committee have also been visiting these hotels to speak with union members. It’s gone very well, and we had a meeting here yesterday, which also went very well,” Sólveig Anna observed yesterday. Tourism advocates are surprised that the strike action is being directed at a single employer. Kristófer Oliversson, the Director of the Association of Companies in Hotel and Accommodation Services (FHG), told RÚV that it was “unbelievable” that these strikes were being directed against almost “a single ID number, a single hotel owner.” “It’s been just over six months since we were properly up and running, and now another setback. And it’s always the same custodial staff that’s being asked to strike. This is about five per cent of Efling members here in Reykjavík who are being asked to take up the fight, again and again. I find it quite incredible,” Kristófer stated yesterday. Sólveig Anna added that this was only the first step. “At the same time, we’ve been working on a bigger and more comprehensive plan, which will then go to a strike vote if no wage agreement is negotiated in the near future,” Sólveig Anna observed. Kristófer told RÚV yesterday that the tourism industry was in “a tight spot” after a difficult time during the pandemic.” There are good months ahead; February has now become a good time to visit Iceland. When the views of tourism advocates were put to Sólveig Anna, the Efling Chair stated that she did buy the argument. “I find it incredible that people who are willing to keep these companies going, to profit from the work of others, lack the decency to pay those same people a living wage.” When asked if she expected that further action by Efling would be directed against the tourism industry, Sólveig refused to answer. “I’m not going to answer that at this time. Ultimately, this is for the negotiating committee to decide. We make all our decisions during meetings with the committee, and I discuss them when they’ve been made,” Sólveig Anna remarked. When asked if any specific groups within the union had refused to strike, Sólveig responded thusly: “No, no groups have refused to go on strike, not at all.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

The minister’s decision to grant this authority to the police should not come as a surprise. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson affirmed that his decision to authorise the police to carry electroshock weapons will stand – despite the criticism. He hopes that the first weapons will be in use by the middle of the year. An amendment to existing regulations is expected to take effect next week. Electroshock weapons will only be assigned to police officers who have received the necessary training, and such weapons may only be used if other, milder measures are not deemed sufficient. “This will, of course, take some time. I expect that the implementation will take approximately one to two years. My hope is that the first officers will begin carrying these electroshock weapons in the middle of the year or so,” Jón observed. Jón has been criticised for not giving Parliament sufficient opportunity to discuss the amendment. During a radio interview yesterday, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir remarked that it would have been more appropriate to discuss the matter more thoroughly in Parliament. “She said that more of a discussion needed to take place, and I have submitted a memorandum to Parliament; the matter has received a certain amount of discussion at that level,” Jón added. When asked if the matter had not been discussed thoroughly enough, Jón replied that it was not for him to judge. “Ultimately, it’s the PM’s decision. This change to the regulation has been carefully prepared, and it has been repeatedly discussed, as I’ve told the media previously; it has not provoked any special reactions or given rise to any special discussion, these reactions that have been expressed,” Jón explained. Jón plans on attending a meeting with the Judicial Affairs and Education Committee next week so as to answer the committee members’ questions. He says that the decision to introduce electroshock weapons was made with the safety of police officers in mind. “I am prepared for any discussion about this and thoroughly present my reasoning behind the decision. A decision has been made based on the information I have and it stands,” Jón concluded.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
517,Iceland Review,Samherji Tax Audit Concludes with Settlement,2023/01/16,"Samherji has reached an ISK 230 million ($1.6 million / €1.5 million) settlement with the Directorate of Tax Investigations in Iceland, RÚV reports. The audit into the company’s books is, therefore, considered complete, although another investigation into alleged bribery and money laundering in Namibia is still undergoing. In a press release published last week, Samherji announced that an investigation launched by the Directorate of Tax Investigations (DTI) in Iceland into two companies within the Samherji Group has concluded with a settlement. The investigation was opened following revelations made by the investigative news programme Kveikur in 2019, RÚV notes. According to the settlement, Samherji and another related company, Sæból, have been made to pay approximately ISK 214 million ($1.5 million / €1.4 million) plus interest and penal interest as a result of the DTI’s reassessment. Samherji will also pay a non-criminal fine of ISK 15 million ($105,000 / €97,000). Experts interviewed by RÚV stated that a settlement means that the case will remain a private matter between Samherji and the Directorate of Tax Investigations and will not go to court, where additional facts concerning the audit could become public. In the aforementioned press release, Samherji noted that the district attorney’s office has dropped criminal charges against the companies and their employees and confirmed that neither the managers nor the employees of the group have been guilty of criminal offences in relation to the audit. District Prosecutor Ólafur Þór Hauksson confirmed to RÚV that the tax side of the office’s investigation into Samherji had been transferred to the tax authorities, which is why the district prosecutor’s investigation into Samherji’s books has been completed. He noted, however, that the office’s investigation into alleged bribery and money laundering by Samherji in Namibia is still under investigation and that that investigation is well advanced. RÚV was unable to reach Þorstein Már Baldvinsson, CEO of Samherji, following the company’s press release, and when the media outlet requested numerical data concerning the case, a representative for the company referred to the press release. Bryndís Kristjánsdóttir, Director of Tax Investigations, has yet to respond to RÚV’s requests for an interview. Samherji’s press release quotes CEO Þorsteinn Már Baldvinsson, who maintains that the DTI took the initiative to conclude the investigation with a settlement: “In these cases, a thorough investigation was carried out on all operations within the Samherji group. The company collaborated with integrity with the tax authorities and provided all requested documents. It should be noted that the Director of Tax Investigations took the initiative to end the cases amicably. There has been an unusually heated discussion about our company and our people, both in the media and in Parliament. It is, therefore, a great relief to be able to clear away serious accusations with the confirmation of official institutions. The key point here is that the cases are now over without any lawsuits being filed against the company or any individual.”","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
518,Iceland Review,Legislation Still Pending on the Taxation of Facebook and Google,2023/01/16,"Imposing a tax on ad revenue collected by foreign tech companies such as Facebook and Google is urgent, the Minister of Culture and Business Affairs told RÚV yesterday. Ad payments to foreign companies totalled approximately ISK 369 million ($2.6 million / €2.4 million) in 2009 and have gradually increased to total nearly ISK 9.5 billion ($67 million / €62 million) in 2021. Efforts have long been made to impose a tax on foreign tech giants such as Facebook and Google, which collect a large share of domestic ad revenue – but pay no taxes in Iceland. This creates something of a void in the operation of Icelandic media companies, as well as the state treasury, RÚV notes. In September 2018, then Minister of Education Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, called a press conference to discuss plans to strengthen the Icelandic media environment by reducing RÚV’s activities in the advertising market and by imposing taxes on foreign tech companies. “This is precisely why we’re proposing a uniform tax on national and foreign online media because a lot of this ad revenue is leaving the country. It’s not just us who are facing this challenge but our neighbouring countries, too,” Lilja observed just over four years ago. RÚV echoed these statements to Lilja Alfreðsdóttir – who now serves as the Minister of Culture and Business Affairs – in an interview yesterday. The minister responded thusly: “We decided to provide operational support to private media companies in Iceland, which was an important step. We’re currently reviewing the tax environment of media companies and taking into account developments abroad. But as I stated in 2018: the time is now, and we’re still working according to that plan.” As noted by RÚV, Statistics Iceland has compiled an overview of the distribution of advertising funds between domestic and foreign media. In 2013, the ad revenue of foreign media increased significantly at the expense of domestic companies. That trend has continued. In 2021, for example, when profits were expected to rebound following COVID, domestic ad revenue increased by 14%, while the ad revenue of foreign companies increased by 34%. Statistics Iceland has also monitored ad payments to foreign companies, which in 2009 were approximately ISK 369 million ($2.6 million / €2.4 million) but increased to almost ISK 9.5 billion ($67 million / €62 million) in 2021. The institution honed in on ad payments made via credit cards, usually originating from smaller companies, or smaller ad campaigns, where foreign tech giants like Facebook and Google play a significant role. Their share of ad revenues has increased from 29% in 2009 when the total revenue was ISK 153 million ($1.1 million / €991,000); to 89% in 2011, when the total revenue was ISK 371 million ($2.6 million / €2.4 million). In 2021, their share of ad revenue was 95%, when total payments amounted to ISK 4.6 billion ($32 million / €30 million). The two companies paid no taxes in Iceland. Given the global nature of the issue, RÚV notes, the government has collaborated with other countries within the OECD on how to tax this revenue. “I hope that we’ll find a solution because there are many domestic companies that rely on a fair competitive position against these international giants,” Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson told RÚV in 2021. Lilja Alfreðsdóttir stated that resolving the issue was an urgent matter but was unwilling to promise that such legislation would be passed this year. “It’s difficult to say. I hoped it would see the light of day in 2019, and then the year after. But then, of course, the attention of most governments shifted to the pandemic. But I feel like there’s a greater understanding of how urgent this is today.”","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
519,Iceland Review,Government to Establish Independent Human Rights Office,2023/01/15,"The Icelandic government hopes to soon establish an independent Human Rights Agency, a watchdog organization that will have the broad mandate of monitoring, promoting, and protecting human rights in Iceland, RÚV reports. It will also develop a national plan on human rights issues, which will be used as the basis for future policymaking. This was announced in the newly published draft of the so-called Green Book on Human Rights. Once the purview of the Ministry of Justice, human rights issues were transferred to the Office of the Prime Minister last year. It was then that Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir decided that a Green Book on human rights should be prepared. As it notes in its introduction, the Green Book “deals with the status and development of human rights in Iceland and gives an overview of key issues ahead and the best solutions for […] resolving them.” An independent agency was one such proffered solution. New agency will operate alongside existing Human Rights Centre The new agency will be separate from the existing Icelandic Human Rights Centre, which was founded in 1995, receives ISK 41.1 million [$289,000; €266,427] in government funding each year, and includes sixteen different member organizations, each of which “deals with human rights in one way or another.” These members include Samtökin ’78, the national LGBTQIA+ organization of Iceland, the Icelandic Women’s Rights Association, Red Cross Iceland, the Icelandic chapters of Amnesty International and Save the Children, among others. The Centre’s goal is to “work towards the advancement of human rights by collecting information on domestic human rights issues, providing information to the public, supporting research and education, and promoting discussion and raising awareness about human rights in Iceland,” and in this way, it already “operates to a large extent like a national human rights office.” However, as it does not have a legal basis, the office doesn’t meet the Paris-aligned benchmarks, thereby necessitating the establishment of a new agency. The existing Human Rights Centre will continue its work alongside the new agency. Building on solid ground  As part of the Green Book drafting process, the government conducted a survey in which it asked Icelanders if they believe that human rights are effectively monitored in Iceland. Just under half of respondents, or 45.2%, said that current human rights’ oversight in Iceland is average, while 26.1% said that the current oversight is handled “pretty well,” 19% responded “pretty poorly.” Four percent of respondents said current oversight is handled “very well,” 4.6% said “very poorly,” and 1% responded “not at all.” “We’re building on really good and solid ground,” said Katrín, remarking on the results of the survey. “In recent years, which I want to include in this, a lot has been done, for instance, in regards to the rights of LGBTQIA+ people. We’ve also made extensive legislative changes to ensure equal treatment and prevent discrimination. So there’s been a lot going on, but what we’ve been trying to do is map the overall situation, which hadn’t been done before.” Katrín also said that she believed the establishment of an independent human rights agency was “definitely a prerequisite if we’re ever going to legislate the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has been in the works for a long time. So we look at this work as a solid foundation for everything that is to come.” Asked when Icelanders could expect the new Human Rights Office to start its work, Katrín said that she would probably present a bill about it in parliament’s upcoming winter session. “So I hope that it would be able to get started shortly after, probably in 2024.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
520,Iceland Review,Efling Union Prepares Strikes Amid Failed Negotiations,2023/01/13,"The Efling Union will present proposals for strike action shortly after the weekend, Vísir reports. If the measures are approved in a vote among the members, the first strikes could be implemented by the end of the month. Three days ago, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, Chair of the Efling Union, broke off negotiations with the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA) and left a meeting with the state mediator. Strike actions are being prepared. “We’ve begun preparations, but, of course, these are complicated measures, which need to be carefully executed. That’s the role of the negotiating committee. It will meet this weekend and continue its work. As far as when the strike notices will be ready, I can’t say at this time – but likely sometime next week,” Sólveig Anna told Vísir. Once the committee has taken the matter into consideration, proposals for strike action will be put to a vote by Efling members. Sólveig Anna told Vísir that it was not clear how the measures would be implemented. “That’s for the negotiation committee to decide. Like all of our decisions, we make them together in a democratic fashion. It’s too early for me to discuss.” Sólveig Anna added that she had not heard from the state mediator since the talks ended, although, she had read in the media that the state mediator “saw no point in calling a meeting.” “Perhaps you should ask him why he sees no point in meeting again, but the answer would no doubt be that SA – as everyone knows – completely refused to accommodate us in any way. Whether something opens up: I hope so, of course.” When asked if strikes could begin by the end of the month, Sólveig stated that that was certainly a possibility. In an interview with Vísir yesterday, Halldóra Sigríður Sveinsdóttir, Chairman of the Báran Union, stated that dozens of Efling members had contacted Báran on Wednesday and Thursday seeking to transfer their membership from Efling to Báran.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
521,Iceland Review,FME Believes Íslandsbanki Broke the Law During March Sale,2023/01/10,"Íslandsbanki has started a conciliation process with the Central Bank’s Financial Supervisory Authority due to the bank’s possible violations of the law, RÚV reports. The bank’s employees were among the buyers in a closed bidding arrangement last March when the government sold a 22.5% stake in the bank. The Central Bank’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) believes that Íslandsbanki may have violated the provisions of laws and regulations, regarding the bank and its operations, during the sale of the government’s 22.5% stake in the bank last March, RÚV reports. This is the result of a preliminary assessment that Íslandsbanki has received. The preliminary assessment states that the Financial Supervisory Authority has the authority to impose administrative fines for the violations. The agency is also authorised to conclude cases through a settlement in the event that the offender admits to the offences and submits to sanctions. Íslandsbanki’s announcement to the Icelandic Stock Exchange states that a conciliation process has begun and that the bank’s management takes FME’s initial assessment seriously: “A conciliation process has begun, and in the coming weeks, the bank will present its explanations and views on FME’s initial assessment. The bank’s management takes FME’s initial assessment seriously. As previously reported, the bank has already made changes to internal rules and processes and will continue such work during the reconciliation process.” Edda Hermannsdóttir, Director of Communication for Íslandsbanki, told RÚV that Birna Einarsdóttir, Íslandsbanki’s Director, could not comment on the conciliation while it was ongoing. As insinuated by RÚV, among the rules violated by Íslandsbanki was allowing employees to buy shares in what was a closed sales process; the bank announced in May that it would be changing its rules regarding its employees’ securities transactions: “There has been a lot of discussion about the sales process and the arrangement employed. Among other things, the participation of the bank’s employees in the sale has been criticised. We take this criticism seriously and are currently working on changes to the bank’s rules regarding employees’ securities transactions,” Birna Einarsdóttir was quoted as saying in an article on Mbl.is last May. RÚV states that the nature of the bank’s other possible violations has not been revealed. Sigmar Guðmundsson, MP for the Liberal Reform Party, called Íslandsbanki’s press release “pitiful” in a post on Facebook yesterday. “The bank’s offences are committed during the sale of public property, and the bank could have shown more initiative in providing information to this same public.” The director of the bank prefers to remain silent during this so-called conciliation process, Sigmar noted, a prerogative not available to other criminal offenders.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
522,Iceland Review,A Fisherman by Any Other Name: Terminology in New Law Sparks Debate,2023/01/08,"A new law regarding ships’ crews that went into effect at the beginning of the month is sparking considerable debate throughout Iceland, but not because of the content of the law. Rather, critics have taken issue with the choice of wording in it, namely the use of the word fiskari, most easily translatable as ‘fisher,’ in lieu of the term fiskimaður, which literally means ‘fisher+man.’ Mbl.is, RÚV, and Vísir have all reported. Critics, including some in the industry and current or former politicians, have called the word choice an example of the sterilization of Icelandic, or even an example of the language’s slide into nýlenska, or Orwellian Newspeak. Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Professor emeritus in Icelandic Language and Linguistics at the University of Iceland, takes a different view, however, noting that the word fiskari is actually a centuries-old Icelandic word and one that was in use long before modern debates about gender neutrality in language. Law aims to ‘promote equal access of the sexes to education, training, and jobs aboard Icelandic ships’ According to the text of the “Law concerning ships’ crews,” 2022 nr. 82, its aim is to “ensure the safety of crews, passengers, and ships, and increase protections against the pollution of the seas. These goals will be achieved by making certain mandates about the education and training, age, sailing time, health, vision, and hearing of those who work onboard and in so doing ensure the professional competence of crews based on the size of the ship, its role, and its area of operation.” This overview goes on to say that the law “is intended to promote equal access of the sexes to education, training, and jobs aboard Icelandic ships.” It then includes an extensive  definition of terms, in which it defines a fiskari as “he or she who works or is hired to work on a fishing vessel…harbour pilots, law enforcement officers, other parties in staff positions working with the public, employees on land who perform work onboard fishing vessels, or fishing inspectors are not considered to be fishers.” It is worth noting that while the word fiskari is being interpreted by critics as inherently gender-neutral because it does not make use of the suffix –maður, meaning ‘man’ (-menn in the plural), fiskari is still a masculine-gendered word in Icelandic. [Note: Icelandic has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.] It is also worth noting that in the Icelandic, the above-quoted definition also includes the use of three additional masculine-gendered terms for different roles/jobs: hafnsögumenn (harbour pilots); starfsmenn (employees); eftirlitsmenn (inspectors). ‘The most ‘woke’ government in the history of Iceland’ Critics, some of whom work within the industry, were quick to voice their dissatisfaction with the word choice. “Fiskari is a malaprop in my opinion,” said Valmundur Valmundsson, the chair of the Icelandic Seamen’s Association. “Sjómannadagurinn [Fishermen’s Day] is never going to be called Fiskaradagurinn [Fishers’ Day].” Eiríkur Óli Dagbjartsson, fishing manager of the Grindavík-based fishing company Þorbjörn hf. felt similarly, telling Morgunblaðið that he thought the shift to the word fiskari was “preposterous.” Current and former politicians have also taken to social media to voice their dissatisfaction. Former Prime Minister and chair of the Centre Party Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson wrote a Facebook post in which he said the use of the word fiskari was part of the “PC-powers’ ongoing attempt to turn Icelandic into Newspeak, in the manner of Orwell” and fretted that “the most ‘woke’ government in the history of Iceland will hardly stop with this.” “It used to be common knowledge that women were also -menn [the plural form of maður, men],” Sigmundur Davíð continued. “That knowledge seems to be getting lost now, as can be observed from the strange explanations of those who think the change [i.e. removing the suffix -maður] is an important step in equality issues.” Sigmundur Davíð then concluded his post by listing off a number of job titles that incorporate the suffix -maður [-man] and which he said were at risk of falling victim next, i.e. that talsmaður [spokesman] might be converted to talari [speaker/spokesperson]. ‘It is important to respect their origin and traditional usage’ In a post on Facebook, former Social Democratic Alliance MP, now a professor in the Department of Social Sciences at Bifröst University, Ólina Kjerúlf Þorvarðardóttir said she could hardly formulate a response. “The words that we use are something other, something more, than just sterile units of meaning, cut and dried,” she wrote. “If that were the case, we couldn’t talk about a living language, about creative manners of expression. Our words are laden with feeling, the way we see life, our circumstances, our history and culture. “The word ‘sjómaður’ has deep-seated emotional implications for many Icelanders, who are familiar with our nation’s struggle for survival over the centuries. Some job titles are compound words using the word ‘maður’ [-man]—flugmaður [pilot], hermaður [soldier], etc—and others aren’t—kennari [teacher], læknir [doctor], prestur [pastor]. It’s well and good that words aren’t all formed in the same way. It is more important, I think, to respect their origin and traditional usage, instead of bending and buckling…the language [according to] some puritanical policy about how words should be created.” Ólina continued: “Sterlization in linguistics is, at best, indifference and incomprehension, and at worst, hostility: to creation, history, and emotion.” The word fiskari dates back to the 16th century What the overriding criticism belies, however, is the word fiskari enjoys a long history and centuries-old usage in Iceland. “This word dates back to the 16th century at least,” says Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Professor emeritus in Icelandic Language and Linguistics at the University of Iceland. “It was in the first book that was printed in Iceland, Oddur Gottskálksson’s translation of the New Testament.” “According to the sources I’ve looked at, it seems that from the 16th century to the 19th century, this was the primary word used for [people who fish], much more common than the word fiskimaður.” Eiríkur points out that in the census from 1845, which recorded Icelanders’ occupations, around 150 people called themselves a fiskari, while only seven called themselves a fiskimaður. “Fiskari is used up until the 20th century,” says Eiríkur. After that, the word fell out of common use and the word fiskimaður became more prevalent. The most common useage, however, is the word sjómaður [seaman].” (As an interesting corollary to Eiríkur’s points, one might consider these words’ frequency in the work of Halldór Laxness, the country’s sole Nobel Prize winner and a passionate advocate for the Icelandic language who is still considered one of its preeminent stylists and practitioners. Per data compiled in the comprehensive online Icelandic dictionary Snara, fiskari appears 20 times in his writings and fiskimaður appears with the exact same frequency: 20 times. The word sjómaður, on the other hand, appears some 65 times.) Returning to the text of the law itself, Eiríkur points to the section where various terms are defined. “A number of words that are used in the law are clarified. In legal texts, it’s important that the meaning of words are clear. It is clear [in the text] that fiskari is a word for people who work on fishing vessels. This is to say, it’s a special term. It is common for legal texts and regulations to use words that have specific and set meanings, where other words are frequently used in everyday speech.” Speaking to concerns related to the fate of other Icelandic words that end in –maður [-man], Eiríkur continues: “Words that end in –maður have an undeniably strong connection to men in many people’s minds. In old rural society, there was a clear difference between male and female laborers,” he explains, giving the examples of the gender-specific words vinnumaður [working man] and vinnukona [working woman] and kaupamaður [merchant-man] and kaupakona [merchant-woman]. “For people who want to demasculinize the language, these words that end in –maður are much more masculine than other words that are grammatically masculine. People ask: why just this one? Why won’t other words that end in –maður be taken? The answer to this is maybe, first and foremost, that this word, fiskari, already existed. In this instance, there was an existing word that could be utilized, a synonym. There is no similar word for sjómaður [seaman] and farmaður [merchant sailor]. We have the word sjóari [seafarer, grammatically masculine but formed in the same way that fiskari is formed; more implicitly gender-neutral], but it’s completely different [in meaning] than the word sjómaður.” [Note: the word sjóari implies that the individual in question is a very experienced sailor, comparable to ‘old salt’ in English.] By using the word fiskari in the text of the new law, lawmakers are reviving an old, existing Icelandic word, says Eiríkur, something that can’t fairly be considered malapropism or ‘incorrect’ language. Language necessarily changes and morphs over time, he says, through common use. “Isn’t that the very definition of ‘correct’ language?” he asks. “That it’s the language people speak?”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

The closure of Reykjanesbraut led to numerous flight cancellations and delays. Following heavy snow in the capital area during the days leading up to Christmas, Reykjanesbraut – the road leading to Keflavík Airport – became impassable. The closure led to numerous flight delays and cancellations, with many travellers expressing their criticism of the Icelandic authorities. Speaking to Mbl.is in December, Minister of Infrastructure Sigurður Ingi Jóhannson stated that the situation was unacceptable: “I have to say, right now, we have to get over this and ensure, as far as that’s possible, that Reykjanesbraut is not closed while the airport is open.” Sigurður Ingi subsequently appointed a work group composed of representatives from the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration, the National Police Commissioner, and the Suðurnes police chief. The work group was tasked with reviewing the events in December and drafting a plan on how best to deal with similar situations. “We are working hard on the report in collaboration with these groups,” Hjördís Guðmundsdóttir, Director of Communications for the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, told Mbl.is this morning.

524,Iceland Review,Taxi Drivers Demand Hearing with the Government,2022/12/20,"Dozens of taxi drivers stopped work yesterday in protest of the newly approved taxi bill submitted by the Minister of Infrastructure. The drivers have serious concerns about the changes included in the bill and are demanding a hearing with the government, Vísir reports. As reported last Friday, taxi drivers staged a protest outside the Minister’s Residence in Reykjavík; expressing their strong objecting to a new bill on taxi services, drivers drove down the street and honked their horns in front of the residence. The bill, which was approved by Parliament later in the day, loosens requirements for operating a taxi and removes of restrictions on the number of work permits, among other things. Taxi drivers’ interest groups strongly opposed the bill, citing concerns that the changes may incite violence against drivers and result in a decline in service quality for the public, and dozens of drivers went on strike yesterday, Vísir reports. In the capital area, there have been unusually long wait times for taxis in recent days. Approximately 150 cars from the company Hreyfill were on the streets of the city at 3 PM yesterday, while there are typically around 200. However, the company claimed that the reduced number of available vehicles was due to weather conditions, rather than the strike by drivers, the article by Vísir explained. “A hundred of our members went on strike today in protest of the recently approved bill,” Daníel Einarsson, Chairperson of the Federation of Icelandic Taxi Drivers, told Vísir yesterday. The association counts approximately 400 members. When asked what they were trying to achieve with these protests, given that the bill had been approved on Friday, Daníel responded thusly: “We tried to get the government to speak with us and consider our concerns, but the bill was rushed through parliament without giving us a chance to voice our opposition,” Daníel stated. He was speaking from inside Hreyfill’s offices, where several taxi drivers had gathered to show their solidarity and express their frustration with how they have been treated by the government. While the protest took place, coffee and donuts were offered to those in attendance. Gunnlaugur Ingvarsson, a taxi driver, added, “it’s not every day that taxi drivers take action like this, but we feel overwhelmed by how we have been treated and how the government has ignored our concerns.

525,Iceland Review,Taxi Drivers Stage Protest in Reykjavík,2022/12/16,"A heated meeting took place among taxi drivers in Reykjavík and Suðurnes yesterday evening to discuss a bill on taxi services sponsored by the Ministry of Infrastructure, RÚV reports. This morning, taxi drivers staged a protest outside the Minister’s Residence in Reykjavík. Outside the Minister’s Residence in Reykjavík this morning, numerous taxi drivers staged a protest, which was eventually stopped by the police; expressing their strong objecting to a new bill on taxi services, taxi drivers drove down the street and honked their horns in front of the residence. Drivers were not allowed to enter the government meeting inside the minister’s residence, however, but Daníel O. Einarsson – the Chairman of the Federation of Icelandic Taxi Drivers (Bandalag íslenskra leigubílstjóra) – took the time to read out a special appeal, Fréttablaðið reports. He requested that the processing of the bill be postponed. “The Federation asks the government to grant working taxi drivers a hearing as regards the bill on taxi services,” Daníel stated. Approval of the bill would open up the door for ride-share services like Uber, which have gained a foothold abroad. The Ministry of Infrastructure posted the bill to the government’s consultation portal (Samráðsgátt) in July. As noted on the website, the draft of the proposed law is similar to former bills that have previously failed to pass through Parliament. Among other things, the bill proposes the abolition of designated taxi zones and removal of restrictions on the number of work permits. It also removes the obligation for taxis to operate through designated stations and proposes alterations to requirements for those who intend to work as taxi drivers. In an interview with RÚV, Guðmundur Börkur Thorarensen, Managing Director of BSR Taxi, stated that the association was dissatisfied with the bill: “We are concerned that a large part of the drivers’ income, 30%, will leave the country in the form of foreign currency; that it will reduce income among drivers; and make the service that we have been offering, over the past few years, much worse,” Guðmundur remarked. Guðmundur maintained that BSR had repeatedly pointed out that more work permits were needed: “But the idea that we should just completely open it up and that there would be no filter as far as quality standards are concerned or the number of drivers, that’s never been on the table.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
526,Iceland Review,VR and SA Agree on Contract,2022/12/12,"VR Union and SA, the Federation of Icelandic Employers, have settled on a short-term contract that will be valid through next year. The agreement will retroactively cover November of this year, and includes a 6.75% wage increase, in addition to increased holiday bonuses and adjusted wage tables for hourly workers. Some have noted similarities between the recent VR contract and that recently reached between SGS and SA. The signing was a rather chaotic affair with representatives from throughout the country present. Official statements were relatively brief, given the long and tiring process it has been so far. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, chairman of the Electrical Industry Association of Iceland, stated to RÚV. “We were trying to press these negotiations as far as possible. I think this is the best outcome under the circumstances.” Notably, Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairperson of VR union, gave no interview after the signing. After the signing, representatives from both the trade unions, SA, and state mediators sat down to celebrate over waffles, a tradition in Icelandic labour contracts.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
527,Iceland Review,"Possible End in Sight for VR, SA Negotiations",2022/12/12,"After a late night of fruitless negotiations between VR and SA, the Federation of Icelandic Employers, an end to bargaining may be in sight. The Assistant State Mediator confirmed that negotiations will resume at 13:00 today, when a final contract will be signed. The details of the final contract are not yet public, but an increased living wage in the face of inflation and rising interest rates has been talked about for some time now. The current negotiations between VR and SA have been ongoing since November 14, but the last 24 hours have been under a media embargo, given the potentially sensitive nature of the details. Efling Trade Union has also had a long and contentious negotiation process. Other unions have also agreed to shorter-term contracts as a compromise in a difficult negotiating climate. A press conference will be held later today a 14:30 in which Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson, and Minister of Infrastructure Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson will give their statements on the importance of the agreement for the labour market. While the content of the agreement is not yet known, in addition to basic wage increases, sources suspect increased measures in child and housing benefits.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
528,Iceland Review,Charges to Be Brought Against Domestic-Terror Plot Suspects,2022/12/09,"The District Prosecutor will push for continued custody over two men suspected of planning a domestic terror attack earlier this year. Formal charges are expected to be brought against the men at the District Court of Reykjavík today. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. Speaking to RÚV today, district attorney Karl Ingi Vilbergsson stated that the District Prosecutor has decided to charge the two suspects for violating Article No. 100 of Iceland’s General Penal Code. The charges are expected to be introduced when prosecutors motion for extended custody over the two men at the District Court of Reykjavík today. RÚV notes that this is likely the first time that such a charge is brought in Iceland. In an interview with Mbl.is, however, Karl Ingi stated that the District Prosecutor had “never considered” charging the suspects on the basis of Article No. 100 of Iceland’s General Penal Code. He was not willing to offer further detail on the content of the charges at this time. As previously noted, the two suspects arrested in September had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had also discussed carrying out attacks against various political figures, among them Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and Chairman of Efling, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir. Article 100 of Iceland’s Penal Code: [Art. 100 a [Punishment of up to lifelong imprisonment shall be imposed on any person committing one or more of the following acts of terrorism with the intention of causing the public serious fear or unlawfully compelling the Icelandic or foreign authorities, or international institutions, to take action or refrain from taking action with a view to weakening or damaging the constitutional structure or the political, economic or social basis of the state or international institution:]1) Article 20 of the General Penal Code states that for “an attempted offence, a more lenient punishment may be imposed than for a completed offence.” This article will be updated.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
529,Iceland Review,"Deported Asylum Seekers Have Right to Reevaluation, Appeals Board Rules",2022/12/06,"The Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board has ruled that a group of asylum seekers have a right to a reevaluation of their applications, RÚV reports. As many from the group have already been deported to Greece, however, a lawyer for the appellants has stated that it might prove difficult for his clients to reappear before the Directorate of Immigration. In October, Reykjavík’s District Court ruled in favour of Palestinian Suleiman Al Masr in his case against the government. The court concluded, among other things, that Al Masr could not be blamed for the delay in the government’s processing of his application, which resulted in his not being deported to Greece (while social restrictions were in effect and travellers were obligated to submit a negative COVID test). Following the decision, Suleiman’s lawyer, Helgi Þorsteinsson Silva, asked the Appeals Board to rule in similar cases. The Appeals Board published the rulings this morning. “There are over twenty rulings and over ten individuals whose applications have been reopened because the premises were similar to Al Masr’s case. For many of them, the decision means that it’s rather likely that they will be granted asylum in Iceland,” Helgi told RÚV. All in all, Helgi believes that there are approximately 100 asylum seekers who have the same cause for appeal. “But what’s interesting is that many of the asylum seekers have already been deported and some of them were arrested and put into custody not so long ago,” Helgi observed, adding that many of those dwelling in refugee camps in Greece would find it difficult to return to Iceland and appear before the Directorate of Immigration. “It’s not uncommon for individuals,” Helgi explained, “who’ve been asylum seekers in Greece for some time, and who don’t have valid visas, for example, to have arrived in Iceland on the basis of Greek travel documents. In some instances, those documents are now expired. It could take a long time to renew those papers,” Helgi remarked, while also noting that the Greek asylum system was on the verge of collapse, as had been widely reported.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
530,Iceland Review,"SGS Signs New Contract with SA, Causing Controversy",2022/12/05,"A new short-term contract has been reached between SGS, one of Iceland’s larger trade unions and SA, the Federation of Icelandic Employers. The agreement was reached on Saturday, December 3, between 17 of SGS’s member organisations and SA. Notably, Efling, SGS’s largest member organisation, was not a signatory to the agreement. Rising interest rates have complicated wage negotiations between many of Iceland’s trade unions and SA, with short-term contracts seen as a compromise to cope with the immediate impact of inflation and interest rates, without locking unions and employers into longer-term contracts that may not be suited to economic conditions in the traditional three-year period. The short-term contract will be valid from November 2022 to the end of January 2024. It includes a flat minimum raise, as well as more holidays and adjustments for inflation. However, the recent SGS contract has come under heavy criticism. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, acting chairperson of the Confederation of Iceland Labour after Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year, stated that the agreement was not suitable for craftsmen. He expressed his wish that the trade unions would stand together during the negotiating process, but that the inconclusive Confederation of Labour Congress earlier this year caused many fault lines to form within the Icelandic labour movement. “As I said after the congress,” stated Kristján to RÚV, “I believed that we could take positive steps forward to strengthen the union. Just like our congressional elections are supposed to do. But it didn’t work, so this is what it’s come to. What we need to do is work on our internal issues and find a way forward.”  In light of difficult labour market conditions, the current round of wage negotiations was seen by many in the labour movement as a time for solidarity in applying pressure against SA, the employer’s union. The recent agreement between SGS and SA is seen by some as a betrayal of labour solidarity at a time when workers hold more power over their employers than usual. Sólveig Anna, chairperson of the Efling union, has also been critical of the contract. She stated to RÚV: “We, of course, do not agree to take part in some deception where what people have already won is being simply repackaged and sold back to them.” Efling is notable as having gone into their negotiations with very ambitious demands. Along with Sólveig Anna, Vilhjálmur Birgisson, chairperson of SGS, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairperson of VR, together represent some of the largest labour organisations in Iceland. The SGS contract, however, has driven a divide between these figures. In a post on social media, Vilhjálmur stated his side of the case, saying that he was “saddened to see people he considered friends stab him in the back.” He also accused other members of the labour movement of leaking details of the contract to complicate the agreement, and of treating the recent agreement “as if a crime had been committed.”    ","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
531,Iceland Review,Reykjavík City Council Approves Extensive Budgetary Measures,2022/12/02,"At a meeting yesterday, Reykjavík City Council approved measures intended to save over ISK 1 billion in operational costs over the coming year, RÚV reports. Among the measures are the expansion of paid-parking zones and decreased subsidies for electric-vehicle charging stations located by apartment buildings. At a City Council meeting yesterday, the majority submitted an amendment to Reykjavík’s 2023 budget. The amendment comprises a total of 92 items, which are expected to save over ISK 1 billion ($7.1 million / €6.7 million) over the coming year. As noted in the meeting’s minutes, City Council deems that the measures reflect “sensible financial management,” noting that the pandemic has impacted municipalities all over the country. “The reaction is natural and befitting the occasion, serving to protect front-line services and vulnerable groups.” Among the measures are amendments to meal purchases for preschools; reduced opening hours for youth centres (which will close at 9.45 PM as opposed to 10 PM), museums, and swimming pools (during holidays); expansion of paid parking zones; and decreased subsidies for electric-vehicle charging stations near apartment buildings; among other things. In an interview with RÚV on Wednesday, Einar Þorsteinsson, Chair of City Council, stated that the residents would “feel these changes.” These budgetary cuts were not fun but necessary in order to improve Reykjavík’s finances. During its meeting yesterday, the City Council also reviewed an interim financial statement for the city’s operations during the first nine months of the year. The statement revealed that the city’s “A Section” – primarily funded by taxpayer money – was operated at an ISK 11.1 billion ($7.1 million / €6.7 million) deficit. In a press release published yesterday, City Council stated that numerous factors had impacted its finances: “A new variant of COVID-19 at the beginning of the year put temporary pressure on operations, especially on the school and welfare system. The war in Ukraine, in addition to the pandemic, led to a shortage of raw goods and slowed down production time, which has negatively impacted global markets and led to increased inflation among our trading partners. The Central Bank, owing to rising real-estate prices, high inflation, and overheating of the domestic economy, raised key interest rates; all of this has had an impact.” As noted in a press release on the City’s interim financial statement, however, the City’s A and B sections – the “B” section includes businesses in part or whole ownership of the city, such as Reykjavík Energy (OR), Associated Icelandic Ports (Faxaflóahafnir), Sopra bs. and Strætó bs., among others – produced a surplus of ISK 6.8 billion ($48 million / €46 million).

532,Iceland Review,Strætó’s Reykjavík Night-Time Service Could Resume Next Year,2022/12/02,"Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson has proposed allocating an extra ISK 51 million ($361,000 / €343,000) of next year’s budget to the operations of Strætó (Iceland’s public bus service), RÚV reports. The increased allotment is intended to cover Strætó’s night-time bus service in Reykjavík during the weekends. In early July, Strætó announced that the Reykjavík night bus, Næturstrætó, would return to service on July 9 following a two-year hiatus in response to low demand during the pandemic. During this hiatus, many capital-area residents had called for its return, arguing that it provided an affordable and safe alternative to taxis. During a trial run between July and October of this year, however – when the night bus departed downtown Reykjavík every hour and stopped at the capital area’s seven suburban neighbourhoods – demand once again proved wanting. As noted in a press release from Strætó in October, an average of 15 passengers travelled aboard the night bus during each trip, which amounts to approximately 300 passengers over a weekend: “In light of this, and given the finances, Strætó’s board has agreed that continuing night-time service during the weekends, now that the trial period has concluded, cannot be justified. The service will, therefore, be discontinued.” At a city council meeting yesterday, however – roughly six weeks after Strætó announced that it would be discontinuing its night-time service – Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson proposed allocating an extra ISK 51 million ($361,000 / €343,000) of next year’s budget to cover Strætó’s night-time bus service. As noted by RÚV, Strætó’s night-time bus service was a key campaign issue for the Progressive Party, which went on to form a majority coalition, during municipal elections last spring.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
533,Iceland Review,Iceland Opens Embassy in Poland,2022/12/01,"Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir is in Warsaw today for the opening of Iceland’s embassy there. In a statement to Morgunblaðið, the minster said: “”The deep respect and friendship that exist between Iceland and Poland is of great value to Iceland, and it is with pride that I take part in opening our embassy in Warsaw on the day of Icelandic Sovereignty.” In her statement, she also pointed out that Poland has had an embassy in Iceland since 2013, and that some 20,000 Polish citizens reside in Iceland, accounting for 40% of all immigrants in Iceland. The minister also stated: “Today the Icelandic embassy in Warsaw will be opened, on the day Icelanders celebrate their sovereignty in 1918. Around the same time, at the end of 1918, an independent and sovereign Poland was rising from the ruins of the First World War. Iceland recognized the Republic of Poland in January 1922 – exactly a century ago – and diplomatic relations officially began in 1946. Since the end of the Second World War, the relations between the countries have been strong and growing in many areas. The most important thing in my mind is that a large number of people from Poland and of Polish origin have enriched Icelandic society by settling here for a longer or shorter period of time. […] Poland has had an embassy in Iceland since 2013, and our relations on many joint platforms are exemplary. However, it is not just to maintain reciprocal relations I made the decision to open an embassy in Warsaw, but I recognize the fact that Poland is one of the leading countries in Europe in cultural, political, scientific and economic terms.”  ",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
534,Iceland Review,Zelenskyy Gifted Icelandic Lopapeysa from Foreign Minister,2022/11/30,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was gifted an Icelandic sweater (i.e. lopapeysa) by Iceland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs on Sunday. “I’m proud and honoured,” the designer of the sweater told Iceland Review this morning. Writing on Facebook yesterday, Icelandic singer Salka Sól described an unusual phone call that she received from the Assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently: “I was asked to knit, for the President of Ukraine, an Icelandic lopapeysa, which the President would receive as a gift from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I couldn’t say no to such a request. I called my collaborator Sjöfn Kristjánsdóttir, and together we knitted two lopapeysur over the space of five days with good help from Eygló (Gísladóttir). Zelenskyy received the sweaters on Sunday … we hope that he’ll be spotted wearing them soon; most of all, however, we hope that the war will end.” In an interview with Iceland Review this morning, designer Sjöfn Kristjánsdóttir echoed Salka’s sentiments: it was the most unusual request that she had received. “We were very surprised, but at the same time, incredibly proud and honoured to be handed this assignment. Zelenskyy is an incredible person, whom we have watched – like the rest of the world – from the sidelines. To be able to contribute, on behalf of the Icelandic nation, is amazing; it’s something that I’ll never forget.” As noted by Sjöfn, the Icelandic lopapeysa is a legally protected product, having received a Designation of Origin status from the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority in 2020; sweaters with the traditional decorative pattern can only be labelled as “Icelandic sweaters” if they are knitted by hand in Iceland using Icelandic wool. “This sweater meets all the criteria,” Sjöfn observed, adding that producing two sweaters in the space of just five days was a lot of work. “Of course, when two hyperactive women come together – they decide to make two sweaters. We knitted incessantly. I had a sick child at home; I made good use of sleepless nights.” As noted in an article on Mbl.is, Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún, alongside other foreign ministers from the Nordic and Baltic countries, met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian ministers on Sunday. The ministers discussed the situation in Ukraine, with representatives from the latter country calling for continued support. The ministers from the Nordic and Baltic countries also acquainted themselves firsthand with the damages wrought by the Russian military and laid a wreath of flowers in honour of the victims of The Holodomor (the Great Famine), which cost millions of Ukrainians their lives between 1932-1933. “It’s important to witness the conditions of the Ukrainian capital with one’s own eyes,” Þórdís Kolbrún was quoted as saying in a press release on the government’s website, “even if our visit was brief. One is, first and foremost, faced with the terrible consequences of Russia’s incessant attacks on the country’s infrastructure. Keeping the electricity on, during the intense and tangible winter cold, is a constant battle: everything is covered in snow and the frost is biting.”

535,Iceland Review,Over 60 Prison Sentences Expired Due to Lack of Cell Space,2022/11/30,"Roughly sixty prison sentences have expired over the past three years owing to shortage of prison cells, RÚV reports. At a session before Parliament yesterday, members of the opposition expressed concern over the state of the country’s prison system. Yesterday, Helga Vala Helgadóttir, MP for the Social Democratic Alliance, opened the discussion on prison affairs before Parliament. Roughly 300 people, of which 279 men, are on prison wait lists. According to Helga Vala, the state of affairs is unacceptable, both for victims and perpetrators: “The aim of legislation on the enforcement of sentences is that sentences be served safely and efficiently in order to deter, whether by particular or general means, criminal offences; however, such a thing can hardly be effective when prisoners cannot begin serving their sentences and when victims must watch perpetrators walk the streets as if they had done nothing wrong. Furthermore, convicted individuals cannot begin to rebuild their lives or must simply trust that their prison sentences expire so that they don’t need to serve time. These are terrible messages to send to society,” Helga Vala stated. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, Chair of the Centre Party, echoed Helga’s sentiments: “Although we sometimes use the phrase human-rights violation rather freely, I would categorise it in these terms: that someone has been sentenced – with all the subsequent consequences on the individual – but must wait in uncertainty as to when that sentence begins,” Sigmundur remarked. As noted by RÚV, since the start of 2020, 64 prison sentences have expired owing to a shortage of cell space. The COVID pandemic played a significant role but also a lack of government funding. The prison system will receive an increase of ISK 250 million ($1.8 million / €1.7 million) according to a bill to amend next year’s budget as proposed by the Minister of Finance. Just Minister Jón Gunnar states that this will completely alter the state of affairs: “One must also consider what the prison authorities are dealing with, namely longer sentences, a greater number of sentences, and a significant increase in the number of individuals being kept in police custody, which wasn’t entirely expected, and which has served to complicate matters. A working group was appointed to review operations and to offer proposals on how to shorten waiting lists. They’re working on it, and once that work is finished, we’ll have a foundation from which to increase the budget and the number of prison guards, and also to operate our prisons more efficiently. This will, of course, be of great help,” Jón stated.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
536,Iceland Review,Hope that Efling Contract Will be Accepted,2022/11/29,"Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, chairperson of Efling trade union, has expressed her optimism that wage negotiations with SA, the Federation of Icelandic Employers, may be reaching an acceptable conclusion. The most recent round of contract negotiations has been complicated by changes in ASÍ (The Confederation of Icelandic Labour) leadership and rising interest rates in the face of high inflation. Normally negotiated for longer terms, a shorter-term contract has been suggested as a stopgap to help what has been a difficult negotiation process. Efling has now agreed to make an offer to SA that will include an ISK 56,700 annual raise (USD EUR), in addition to other cost-of-living allowances. The contract as offered will be valid until January 31, 2024. Cost of living has been a pressing issue in the recent renegotiations, and Efling’s current offer represents a much more humble demand than some of their previous suggestions. However, a statement by the union highlights that the current offer represents what would have been the gains in the first year of a normal three-year contract: “In the opinion of the negotiating committee of Efling, the agreed increases need to protect the households of low- and middle-income earners from the effects of inflation and guarantee them a fair share in economic growth and the profits of the company. […] The bargaining committee of Efling believes that other unions have made a mistake by agreeing to percentage increases in negotiations with SA. There have been proposals for discussion where high-income groups are expected to benefit twice as much as low-wage earners.” Here, Efling refers to a debate within trade unions on whether to go to the bargaining table with demands for flat wage increases, or percentage-based wage increases. Percentage-based wage increases favour higher earners, and such demands have been a cornerstone of BHM’s demands (The Icelandic Confederation of University Graduates). However, for lower wage earners, flat increases to wage generally tend to increase buying power more directly. Efling submitted their offer to SA yesterday. Previously, they had submitted similar terms, but SA rejected them on grounds of the length of the contract. Now, Efling is hoping that the new, shorter contract will be accepted. In a statement, Sólveig Anna said: “We will see how this shapes up. I’m not ready to say that we’ve reached the finish line. I know it’s a complicated game we’re playing […] I think it’s likely that we need to do something more, but the message to us was clear and meaningful.”  ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
537,Iceland Review,"VR Leaves Negotiating Table, Finance Minister Denies Blame",2022/11/25,"The Prime Minister has expressed disappointment in VR’s decision to break off wage negotiations with SA Thursday evening. The Minister of Finance does not believe his comments on the Central Bank’s interest-rate hike were “the deciding factor,” RÚV reports. This morning, Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chair of VR (the Store and Office Workers’ Union) confirmed to RÚV that he had walked out of negotiations with SA (the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise) last night, which had recently been referred to the state mediator. The reasons, Ragnar stated, were “numerous,” although the incongruous messaging of Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktson concerning the Central Bank’s interest-rate hikes “played a role.” Prior to the Central Bank announcing that it would be raising interest rates, VR and SA had been aiming toward an agreement predicated on less inflation and a lower interest rate: “But then the Central Bank announced a hike, which, in reality, altered the premises from which we had hoped to proceed,” Ragnar Þór told RÚV. “The PM subsequently invited us to a meeting yesterday morning, in which she attempted to reset the parties’ expectations. It was a pretty good meeting.” Ragnar observed that the parties proceeded to Karphúsið (the facilities of the state negotiator) where they hoped to continue their negotiations at noon. “We’ve hardly taken our seats when an announcement is made by the Minister of Finance in which he echoes the Governor’s (the Central Bank) message, which is completely at odds with what the PM had told us. After that, the negotiations became quite difficult. And when it became clear the kind of ideas that SA were entertaining regarding a 14-month contract, which we had been discussing, it was obvious that there was no ground to continue negotiating.” Following a cabinet meeting this morning, Katrín Jakobsdóttir discussed Thursday’s wage-negotiation collapse with RÚV. Asked if she had wished that the Central Bank had not raised interest rates, Katrín responded thusly: “The Central Bank makes its own decisions in accordance with the statutory aims under which it operates. It’s not my place to comment on those decisions, but it is clear that this decision led to the collapse of negotiations.” “I regret the fact that VR decided that it was appropriate to leave the negotiating table at this time, but I hope that we can find some kind of opening,” Katrín added. This morning, Bjarni Benediktsson was asked to respond to Ragnar Þór’s claim that his comments, justifying the Central Bank’s actions, had been a deciding factor in the collapse of negotiations. “No, I think it’s always best to be completely honest about things,” Bjarni remarked. “And I just saw an announcement from VR where no mention is made of my comments; it’s likely that the premises had changed following the Central Bank’s decisions, premises which likely were the basis for the parties’ negotiations.” Bjarni told RÚV that it was clear that inflation would rise and that it was only natural for the Central Bank to employ those tools at its disposal to keep inflation in check: “But the truth is that the inflation forecasts have worsened, and the ghost of inflation is set to follow us a bit longer, and inflation will be higher next year than we had hoped just a few months ago. The tension in the economy runs high. We’re nearing maximum production capacity and the level of employment is very high. Consumption is high, which is one of the factors to which the Central Bank has pointed. It doesn’t really surprise me that the Central Bank continues to send these clear messages, that it will continue to fight inflation, and it’s desirable that all of us cooperate to do the same.” VR is Iceland’s largest trade union, representing some 40,000 workers.  ",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
538,Iceland Review,"Prison Guards to Receive Stab-Resistant Vests, Possibly Tasers",2022/11/25,"The Minister of Justice will answer the call from prison guards regarding increased training and protective equipment, Mbl.is reports. The Director General of Prison and Probation Administration notes a worrying trend of violence and weapons use within Icelandic prisons. As noted in an article published on Mbl.is yesterday morning, violence and weapons use among Icelandic prisoners have greatly increased over the past years. In light of this trend, prison guards have called for better protective equipment, stab-resistant vests, and, in some instances, access to tasers. Páll Winkel, Director General of Prison and Probation Administration, told Mbl.is that the prison system was facing a “new reality,” with weapons now being confiscated from cells and common areas on a regular basis. “This was almost unheard of, a couple of years ago. It’s my responsibility, first and foremost, to ensure the safety of my employees. We’re not enthusiastic about carrying weapons within our prisons, but we obviously need to reassess our protocols. And we may need to reconsider how we interact with certain groups of inmates, i.e. those who create and carry makeshift weapons,” Páll stated, adding that these weapons were improvised from shards of plexiglass, saw-blades, screwdrivers, screws, and nails. Speaking to Vísir.is yesterday, prison guard Sigurður Rúnar Hafliðason stated that he’d experienced these trends first-hand: “We’ve got this much tougher, more violent core of prisoners, who are also abusing drugs to a greater extent. And so there’s a big difference in how we’re managing prisoners today, compared to when I was starting.” As noted by the article, three serious assaults have been perpetrated against prison guards this year. According to Sigurður, the younger generation of prisoners commonly carries knives and post-traumatic stress has increased among prison guards. Sigurður Rúnar doesn’t necessarily believe that tasers are necessary, arguing that stab-resistant vests and improved training is vital. “We need to improve safety … we need training so that people feel safe while they’re at work.” Mass arrests and budgetary constraints have also put pressure on an already strained system. In an article published in Morgunblaðið this morning, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated that the safety of prison guards and police officers was “a priority.” “What’s happening inside prison walls reflects broader trends within our society,” Jón remarked. “I’ve had extensive conversations with the prison authorities, and it’s clear that we must respond on many different levels.” According to Jón, this response will, among other things, include stab-resistant vests. The Ministry is also considering equipping prison guards with tasers. “We’ve repeatedly witnessed serious incidents within the country’s prisons. It’s clear that it’s necessary to equip our people in such a way that their safety is ensured at their places of employment. And we do that by providing better protective equipment. Additionally, we need to consider structural organisation; we can’t allow things to develop in such a manner within our prisons.” Physical altercations involving knives have been in the news lately, with a knife attack at the Bankastræti Club nightclub last weekend and a fifteen-year old boy being stabbed in the Garfarvogur neighbourhood of Reykjavík earlier this week.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
539,Iceland Review,Number of Apartments Sold in Capital Area Hits Two-Year Low,2022/11/25,"331 apartments were sold in the capital area in October, a 22% decline compared to the previous month. The number of apartments sold in the capital area has hit a two-year low, Fréttablaðið reports. This week, the Central Bank announced that it was raising key interest rates by an additional 0.25%. Short-term interest rates (seven-day term deposits) would thereby reach 6%. The increase, which serve to complicate wage negotiations, came in response to a month-on-month rise in inflation, which rose from 9.3% in September to 9.4% in October. In an interview with Fréttablaðið, Ýmir Örn Finnbogason, an analyst at Deloitte, explained that rising interest rates had led to a cooling real-estate market; an update to Deloitte’s real-estate dashboard, based on statistics from Registers Iceland, showed a 22% decline in the sale of apartments in the capital area in October when compared to September. As noted by Deloitte’s report, even though sales have declined, prices have remained almost unchanged between the months: the average price of a square metre for an apartment was ISK 709,000 ($5,000 / €4,800) October, ISK 2,000 ($14 / in €14) higher than in September. “Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have an obvious effect,” Ýmir Örn told Fréttablaðið. Ýmir expects the real-estate market to continue cooling over the coming months, in light of growing tensions in the economy and wage negotiations. As noted by Deloitte, single-family homes and apartments have followed the same trend, with fewer properties being sold in both categories: the number of single-family homes sold in October compared to September declined by 16%. The average price of a square metre also declined from ISK 647,000 ($4,600 / €4,400) to ISK 624,000 ($4,400 / €4,300). “Real-estate prices reflect consumers’ investment power, which is primarily affected by the cost of borrowing money, i.e. interest rates. And rising interest rates obviously lead to a cooling market,” Ýmir Örn stated. As noted by Fréttablaðið, the price of apartments and multi-family homes have risen in North and East Iceland but fallen in South and West Iceland.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
540,Iceland Review,Rising Interest Rates Complicate Upcoming Wage Negotiations,2022/11/24,"The recent hike in interest rates has complicated the upcoming wage negotiations, with government involvement now a possibility to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. Now, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has invited leaders from both sides of the bargaining table to a meeting to find a path forward. This fall, around 1/3 of labour contracts are expiring and need to be renegotiated. Matters have been further complicated by turmoil at the 45th ASÍ congress (The Icelandic Federation of Labour, Iceland’s largest federation of trade unions), which have left the leadership of this organisation unclear. Individual unions have begun renegotiating their contracts, mostly with SA (The Confederation of Icelandic Employers). Recent increases to the interest rate in Iceland have complicated negotiations, with talks with VR and several other unions and SA breaking down yesterday. The rate increases came in the wake of inflation numbers for October being higher than expected. The 0.25% increase to 6% interest (seven-day term deposit rate) is intended to bring inflation back into an acceptable range. Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, has previously called on the labour market to help in the fight against inflation, as wage demands at the bargaining table could have an exacerbating effect on inflation. Alongside the rate increases, the Central Bank of Iceland’s Monetary Policy Committee released a statement that inflation forecasts could turn out to be too optimistic if the ongoing wage negotiations lead to wages rising in excess of the Central Bank’s predictions. Consumer spending in September and October has proved higher than expected, and some fear that wage demands may drive up consumer spending and therefore prices. Vísir quotes Ásgeir as stating “Our task is to ensure price stability and we believe by doing this, we are supporting the wage negotiations. It would be futile to negotiate such wage increases only to have them burn up in inflation. The Central Bank is therefore of the opinion that it is contributing to the process by ensuring this does not happen.” Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson stated regarding the rate hikes that although the increase had been a “splash of cold water” for many, it nevertheless sent “a necessary message to leaders in the labour market.” The Central Bank of Iceland’s Monetary Policy Committee has a set inflation target of 2.5%. Inflation currently sits at 9.4%. The rate hike has, however, drawn critique from both sides of the bargaining table. Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairperson of VR trade union, said that because of this, the negotiations between VR and SA will be terminated and, as a result, harsh measures will have to be taken. Halldór Benjamín Þorbergsson, director of SA, also said he disagreed with the Central Bank’s interest rate decision. The decision, according to Halldór, put the wage negotiations in “upheaval” and the bank’s credibility has been “damaged” by this interest rate increase. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has stated that the government supports a quick conclusion to the negotiations, suggesting the possibility of shorter-term contracts as a solution: “I think that all parties understand that events have not been particularly favourable for us. First an epidemic, then a war, inflation and the consequences of Russia’s war in Ukraine. So, of course, we all realize that there is considerable uncertainty, which may make a short-term contract a more viable option. But it is of course entirely in the hands of those sitting at the negotiating table to make that decision.” Katrín continued, saying that it would be bad for all parties involved if negotiations were to break down: “Of course that would be bad. It is in the interest of all in our society that there is peace in the labour market. That workers can live on their wages. That business can continue. It’s in all of our interests.”  ","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
541,Iceland Review,Finnish PM Sanna Marin on Official Visit to Iceland,2022/11/23,"Finnish PM Sanna Marin is on an official state visit to Iceland. On the agenda for her meetings with Icelandic PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir are the energy transition, climate change, Nordic cooperation, and the War in Ukraine. Finland, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has applied for membership in NATO, to which Iceland has belonged since its 1949 foundation. Previously neutral, the invasion has forced Finland to reassess its security situation, which will now be the topic of talks between the two PMs. Among the several events and roundtables the Finnish PM has attended include a talk at the Nordic House and a “lunch-time chat” at the National Museum of Iceland. Though Finland has remained officially neutral for decades, it has in the past cooperated with NATO exercises and projects. This past May, it officially announced its intention to apply for NATO membership, alongside fellow Nordic nation Sweden, which had also been neutral. PM Sanna Marin also spoke about the importance of women in positions of power, calling it a great need. Even in Europe, few women are in leadership positions, but she identified the Nordic nations as leading forces in this regard. Icelandic PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir likewise spoke to the importance of having people with diverse backgrounds in leadership positions, and for people with different experiences to be heard and recognised. Katrín Jakobsdóttir also highlighted the common commitment shared by the Nordic nations to social-democratic ideals: “We have open debates and we have strong national assemblies in our communities. This is not least important because we are seeing certain democratic setbacks. Not only in distant countries, but in Europe as well. These values of the Nordic countries are more important than ever.” Agreeing that the Nordics share much in terms of history and culture, the Finnish PM stated that Iceland and Finland stand to learn much from one another. Joking, she also stated: “Of course, even though Iceland isn’t a part of the EU, it’s always welcome.” Building on the strong history of cooperation, Katrín Jakobsdóttir cited research, development, and education as fields to be further improved between the nations. Notably, Iceland was one of he first nations to openly support Finland and Sweden’s NATO applications, which are still pending approval.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
542,Iceland Review,Minister of Justice’s Police Bill Approved by Cabinet,2022/11/22,"A new bill on policing, sponsored by the Minister of Justice, was approved by the coalition government this morning, Vísir reports. The Minister expects the bill – which will, among other things, authorise proactive investigations – to be enacted shortly after the new year. A day after Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson announced his intention to “wage war on organised crime in Iceland,” his proposed amendment to the Police Act has been approved by the cabinet. The bill, which was been in the works by the Ministry of Justice for some time, was submitted for public review and commentary in March of this year. Speaking to Vísir, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated that he expected the bill to be distributed among the parliamentary parties tomorrow. The purpose of the bill is to grant greater authority to the police in its effort to deter crime, especially in relation to organised crime and national security. “We’re trying to move closer to those police protocols that have been adopted by our neighbouring countries,” Jón stated. The bill will authorise proactive investigations and enshrine in law regulations concerning the use of weapons among police. “We refer to it as crime deterrence, allowing the police to begin investigating individuals who although not suspected of committing a crime are believed to be associated with organised crime, or other operations that pose a risk to national safety. Such investigations would, however, always be launched by the Chief of Police or other senior officers. We will also establish an office of internal affairs, which will always be notified in the event of such investigations. A supervisory committee will also be notified as early as possible.” Jón hopes that the bill will be enacted quickly. “I’m hoping that the bill passes through parliamentary review tomorrow and that I’ll be able to address Parliament next week. Then it’s, of course, up to the parliamentary committee to discuss. I know that the general committee has been quite busy recently, so we’ll have to see how quickly things progress. I think it’s realistic to hope that the bill would be enacted shortly after the new year, that is, if it’s not been enacted before Christmas.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
543,Iceland Review,Mass Arrests Put Pressure on Already-Strained Prison System,2022/11/22,"Iceland’s prison system is operating at near maximum capacity. Three times as many individuals are being kept in police custody than usual, the Director General of Prison and Probation Administration has stated. The police arrested 27 people following a knife attack at the Bankastræti Club in Reykjavík last Thursday. Twelve suspects have been kept in custody, with the police having yet to decide whether they will request custody over five additional suspects. Four other individuals connected to the attack remain on the lam, some of whom are believed to have fled the country. Páll Winkel, the Director General of Prison and Probation Administration, told Mbl.is that a total of 60 people are currently being held in police custody – three times the usual number. Aside from the many arrests made in relation to the Bankastræti Club attack, there have also been numerous arrests made in connection with drug busts and violent crimes. “It does, of course, put tremendous pressure on the system,” Páll observed, “detaining 15 prisoners in isolation. It calls for greater manpower and organisation; you need to safeguard investigative interests, that the prisoners don’t meet, while, at the same time, ensuring that their rights are being respected.” “These are people aged 19 and up. These are Icelanders and foreigners, men and women, non-disabled and disabled persons, including one individual who’s blind.” Most of the prisoners are being detained in the Hólmsheiði prison, although some have been transferred to Litla-Hraun. According to Páll, the design of Hólmsheiði has proven advantageous, as there are spaces equally suited to regular confinement and isolation. Páll predicts that the situation will remain unchanged for a few more days but hopes that that will be the extent of it. “It puts tremendous strain on the system. Also because it happens to coincide with our effort to temporarily decrease the number of prisoners so as to operate within budget constraints.” Speaking to RÚV, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated that the government had already taken steps to deal with the pressure on the prison system, with extensive renovations at the Litla-Hraun prison expected to be completed next year. According to Jón Gunnarsson, there have been instances where prison sentences lapse owing to a lack of cells. “We must respond, and we are doing our best,” he stated, admitting that increasing the number of prison cells would take time and that bridging the gap could prove tricky. “We’re not quite sure how; this additional pressure means additional operational costs, and we’ve even been in the position where we’ve been unable to fully use all of the prison cells because of budgetary constraints … we’re working on it.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
544,Iceland Review,Minister of Justice to Declare War on Organised Crime,2022/11/21,"Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson has announced his intention to wage war against organised crime following the knife attacks in a Reykjavík club last week, which have been taken as signs of gang warfare. On Thursday night, November 17, a group of masked and armed men stormed a Reykjavík nightclub, stabbing three men, who were since transported to the ER. Of the nearly 30 men involved in the attack, already some 14 have been apprehended by the police. Two are suspected to have fled the country, with the police now searching for the remaining suspects. According to Minister Jón Gunnarsson, the incident reveals a problem with organised crime in a nation generally upheld for its security. In response to the minister’s call for a “war on crime,” efforts are now being prepared to attack the root causes of organised criminality in Iceland. The Minister has also expressed his desire to strengthen police powers, with what Jón Gunnarsson calls “preventative warrants,” allowing for “proactive investigation.” Such measures have been controversial in Alþingi, but Jón Gunnarsson has stated that his proposals would be “harmless.” Such warrants would allow police to monitor individuals associated with known criminals and criminal activity, without themselves being found guilty of any crime. The proposed measures would also add tasers to the police arsenal. Currently, Icelandic police officers only carry batons and pepper spray in the field. In a statement to Vísir, the Minister said: “The steps we take may prove to be controversial, I have no doubt about that. Both of these new authorisations, for preventative warrants and weapons for the police, may be controversial, but we have to do it.”  ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
545,Iceland Review,"Report on Íslandsbanki Sale Highlights Lack of Transparency, Reliance on Outside Consultants",2022/11/14,"State regulators have released a report on the controversial sale of Íslandsbanki shares that took place this March. Among the considerations of the report are details on the dissemination of information of the sale, the determination of its sale price, and the selection process for determining the qualified investors. After the 2008 banking collapse, the insolvent banks were restructured, leading to the partial socialisation of Iceland’s three major banks, Landsbankinn, Arion, and Íslandsbanki. Landsbankinn continues to be held by the state with a majority share. However, Íslandsbanki has been gradually privatized since the restructuring, with an initial 35% of Íslandsbanki shares being sold in June 2021. After a sharp rise in share prices after the sale, some claimed that the shares were undervalued. In March 2022, a second round of sales was slated, with 22.5% of Íslandsbanki shares to be sold off. This second offering, however, was not a public offering like the first, but was limited to a group of “qualified investors.” Among the qualified investors were the usual suspects, including foreign and domestic investors, and pension funds. However, the list also included some notable individuals such as Benedikt Sveinsson, father of Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and the individual legally responsible for the sale. The revelations caused widespread critique of Bjarni, the oversight committee, and the coalition government in power. There were also claims of insider trading, as significant numbers of investors sold off their holdings within days and weeks after a climb in price. In total, the sale involved 450 million shares in the bank to 207 investors. The selling price was ISK 117 per share and the sale proceeds amounted to ISK 52.7 billion (USD 361,000,000; EUR 351,000,000). The state’s share in Íslandsbanki is now 42.5%. Now, the Icelandic National Audit Office is trying to determine the nature of the sale, how the investors were selected, and how the Íslandsbanki share were valued. The official report can be seen here. According to the report, the sale could have been better prepared and executed. Outside the scope of the report are the legitimacy and legality of the sale, which are left to the Financial Supervision Authority of the Central Bank of Iceland. Instead, the report focuses on the technical execution of the sale and its valuation of the shares. According to the report, “the language used in the documents submitted by the Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI) to parliament was not suitable for drawing a clear picture of the arrangement of the sale process. Despite the experience and knowledge of the employees and the board of the Banking Authority in the field of administration and sale of the state’s holdings in financial companies, the institution did not have experience in bidding arrangements in the run-up to the sale […] Adequate conditions were not given to supervisors, sales consultants and dealers, and due to shortcomings in the implementation, demand was underestimated when deciding on the indicative final price. Sufficient consideration was not given to possible reputational risks, nor were the principles of transparency observed. As the bidding system was implemented, it could not guarantee full equality for the investors to whom it was directed.” The report also identifies an over-reliance on external consultants in the private sector.      ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
546,Iceland Review,Protests in Front of Parliament in Wake of Deportations,2022/11/07,"Protestors last week flocked to Austurvöllur square in front of Iceland’s parliament in response to the recent deportation of Icelandic refugees. The protests took place Thursday, November 3, and Sunday, November 6 with some thousand people in attendance. The recent wave of deportations is the largest in recent history in Iceland, with some refugees being deported as their applications for asylum status were still under consideration by the Directorate of Immigration. Isavia, the company responsible for running Keflavík International Airport, has also come under critique for its involvement in the deportations. The Journalists’ Association of Iceland has accused Isavia of obstructing the work of journalists covering the deportations, turning floodlights against a crowd of reporters. Isavia has published a statement regretting their involvement, saying that they were following police instructions, who requested that Isavia staff prevent filming of the deportations.

According to Icelandic police, they are now considering having vehicles more suitable for wheelchairs. Further critique has been raised by the confiscation of refugees’ phones. Icelandic police state that the refugees’ phones were taken from them in order to ensure their safety. Helgi Valberg Jensson, Chief Legal Office of the National Police, stated to Vísir: “We had individuals in custody, and it was our duty to ensure their safety.  Whether this needs to be revised is something we will consider moving forward.” Police body cameras were also reported to have been turned off during portions of the raids. Helgi has stated that this for the privacy of individuals who may feel uncomfortable. Among the critics of the recent deportations are the United Nations Children’s Fund in Iceland, the Icelandic branch of Amnesty International, the Disabled Persons’ Association, the Red Cross in Iceland and the Icelandic Teachers’ Association.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

548,Iceland Review,Bjarni Benediktsson Reelected as Independence Party Chair,2022/11/07,"Bjarni Benediktsson has been reelected as the chair of the Independence Party on Sunday. His leadership, which many have come to see as an embodiment of establishment politics, was challenged by Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, the current Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. RÚV reports that Bjarni won the election with 59.4% of the vote, versus the 40.4% earned by Guðlaugur Þór. The Independence Party’s National Convention is generally held every two years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been held for four and a half years. Guðlaugur’s challenge is perhaps a sign of needed change in a party whose leadership has remained frozen by recent events. In the wake of the vote, both Bjarni and Guðlaugur Þór emphasized the importance of party unity and both anticipate that Guðlaugur Þór will retain his ministerial position. It had previously been suggested that losing the election would have political ramifications for Guðlaugur Þór. “We have to stand together to push the party through the rebuilding phase,” said Bjarni. Bjarni has been active in politics since 2003, when he was elected as a representative in Alþingi, Iceland’s parliament. Since then, he has also served as Iceland’s prime minister and is now both chairperson of the Independence Party, Iceland’s centre-right party, and Minister of Finance. His tenure as Minister of Finance has been punctuated by several major corruption scandals, the most recent of which revolved around the sale of Íslandsbanki shares.

549,Iceland Review,Commissioner’s Father Unable to Account for Dozens of Firearms,2022/11/04,"The father of Police Commissioner Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir was unable to account for dozens of firearms discovered at his home during an investigation of a domestic-terror plot. No investigation was opened into his actions, despite his admission that he had sold illegally modified weapons in exchange for cash payment, RÚV reports. As reported in late September, National Police Commissioner Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir recused herself from an investigation into a domestic-terror plot after the home of her father, Guðjón Valdimarsson – a well-known weapons collector and vendor – was searched during the investigation. According to RÚV, a search of Guðjón’s home revealed nearly forty unlicensed firearms, for which Guðjón was unable to adequately account. Guðjón was not arrested, however, and the police have not divulged his legal status in relation to the investigation. This is not the first time that Sigríður Björk has been forced to recuse herself from an investigation. In 2018, Sigríður’s father was also entangled in an investigation involving the alleged offence of an individual in possession of a DPMS rifle that had been modified to function as semi-automatic. “In that case, the sole aim of the investigation was whether the buyer – who did not have the knowledge, the tools, nor the access to spare parts – had modified the weapon himself. The individual who sold the rifle, however, was only interrogated as a witness,” Einar Gautur Steingrímsson, attorney for the man who was charged with the weapons offence, told RÚV. As noted by RÚV, the accused was acquitted before the Court of Appeal (Landsréttur) as the prosecution failed to prove that he had modified the weapon. The case was thereby closed, without any investigation being opened into whether Guðjón Valdimarsson, or someone else, had modified the weapon. “It’s completely mind-boggling that someone who sells a firearm, which has been modified, is not the subject of the investigation alongside the buyer; the person who modified the weapon is not investigated but rather the person who couldn’t,” Einar Gautur added. Guðjón was, however, interrogated, although the interrogation was conducted at his home in Hafnarfjörður and not at the police station. Police reports do not indicate why the interrogation took place at his home. RÚV also notes that it possesses documents proving that the defendant in the aforementioned case had paid Guðjón ISK 1.5 million ($10,00 / €10,000) for the weapon, in cash. No receipt or invoice changed hands during the time of the transaction (i.e. no tax was paid). During his interrogation, Guðjón partially confirmed that the transaction had been conducted with cash for ISK 700,000 ($5,000 / €5,00). In an interview with Vísir published this morning, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson maintained that the police had not protected the Police Commissioner’s father. “I’ve no information to indicate that such a thing happened,” Jón remarked. “As far as that older case (from 2018) is concerned, during a time when the Police Commissioner was employed as the Chief of the Capital Area Police, she declared her conflict of interest and recused herself. The investigation was subsequently transferred to someone else.” Jón went on to suggest that he wasn’t adequately familiar with the details of the current investigation to comment but that the Police Commissioner appeared to have comported herself ethically. When asked whether it wasn’t clear that the legislation on firearms needed to be amended – to prevent individuals from hoarding firearms, among them semi-automatic weapons – Jón stated that he hoped such amendments would be concluded before the end of the year. “When I arrived at the Ministry, I realised that this legislation would need to be reviewed. We’re in the process of doing so now, as I’ve previously announced.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

Writing on Twitter yesterday, Sjón cited “the cruel treatment of asylum seekers” by Katrín’s cabinet. Iceland Noir is a literary festival held in Reykjavík celebrating “darkness in all its forms.” Founded in 2013 by authors Ragnar Jónasson and Yrsa Sigurðardóttir, Iceland Noir began as a celebration of crime fiction but has gradually evolved to welcome writers outside the genre while also including television and film screenings alongside panels. This year’s festival will be held between November 16 and 19 and will be headlined by Bernardine Evaristo and Richard Osman alongside Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir. Other notable guests include First Lady of Iceland Eliza Reid, English novelist Mark Billingham – and Icelandic writer Sjón.

Among those deported was a disabled Iraqi, in Iceland with a family of five, whose lawyer has told the media that he is preparing a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights. The treatment of the man inspired public outcry and a protest was held on Austurvöllur Square, in front of Parliament, at 5.15 PM yesterday. The protest was organised by No Borders Iceland and Solaris (an aid organisation providing assistance to asylum seekers and refugees in Iceland) and was “well attended” according to Vísir. Katrín Jakobsdóttir spoke to Vísir in response to the public outcry yesterday, maintaining that it was “only natural for people to become upset” whenever force was applied in cases such as these: “But what we must look into, in particular – and I think that I speak for everyone – is the treatment of the disabled person, who was among those asylum seekers who were deported. It’s extremely important that we take great pains when it comes to vulnerable groups of people and that we ensure that his rights were fully respected.” Isavia, Iceland’s national airport and air navigation service provider, apologised for hindering the work of photojournalists during the deportations at Keflavík Airport.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
551,Iceland Review,Sixteen Middle Managers at Landspítali Hospital Dismissed,2022/11/01,"Sixteen middle managers employed at the National University Hospital of Iceland received letters of termination yesterday, RÚV reports. The terminations stem from the adoption of a new organisational chart intended to improve the hospital’s operations. A new organisational chart will come into effect at the National University Hospital on January 1. According to director Runólfur Pálsson, the organisational chart is intended to simplify the hospital’s operations and make them more efficient. “The main purpose is to get a handle on the hospital’s management and operations, to strengthen our clinical services, and to harmonise other key services,” Runólfur remarked in an interview with RÚV. Over the past months, questions concerning the sustainability of the hospital’s operations have come to the fore. When asked if these changes would be felt by the public, Runólfur replied: “I hope it’ll translate into a stronger hospital, that we’ll be able to improve our service: improve our emergency services, the flow of patients while also strengthening our surgical department. If we’re successful in this regard, then the public will certainly feel it.” The hospital’s organisational chart was introduced to the Minister of Health today. The changes imply a decrease in the number of middle managers and increased responsibility among front-line managers. “Six directorial positions will be cut, but there are two positions that are bound by law, namely the directorship of nurses and medicine – but the other six will be cut alongside all of the ten managerial positions,” Runólfur remarked. As reported by RÚV, the sixteen individuals holding the aforementioned positions received a letter of notice yesterday. Runólfur added that because the organisational chart had yet to be implemented, it remained to be seen whether it would result in increased efficiency. “These are big changes, and we must be aware that changes to the organisational chart, in themselves, are not enough to improve our output – there are other things that must work out as well,” Runólfur stated. “But the purpose of these changes is to get a better handle on and harmonise our clinical services. In the near future, we will aim to overhaul all of the clinical organisational units in the front line and strengthen its management affording them greater responsibility.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
552,Iceland Review,Bjarni Benediktsson to Resign from Politics if Successfully Challenged,2022/10/31,"In a recent interview with RÚV, Independence Party chairperson Bjarni Benediktsson claimed that he will retire from political life if he loses the contest for party leadership. The statements come in light of Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarsson’s recently announced intentions to seek Bjarni’s position. The Independence Party’s National Convention is generally held every two years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been held for four and a half years. Guðlaugur’s challenge is perhaps a sign of needed change in a party whose leadership has remained frozen by recent events. Guðlaugur himself has stated that very little separates his and Bjarni’s platforms. “It’s primarily about the personalities,” he stated to RÚV, which could be a reference to discontent over Bjarni’s involvement in several corruption scandals, the most recent of which involved him in his role as Minister of Finance in the sale of Íslandsbanki shares. Bjarni has been active in politics since 2003, when he was elected as a representative in Alþingi, Iceland’s parliament. Since then, he has also served as Iceland’s prime minister and is now both chairperson of the Independence Party, Iceland’s centre-right party, and Minister of Finance. In his long political career, he has become something of the embodiment of establishment politics. Some see Guðlaugur’s challenge as a chance for reform within the party. If Guðlaugur is to lose his attempt at seizing party leadership, there has been talk of political consequences for him and the party, with some suggesting the possibility that he be removed from his current ministerial seat. Eva Heiða Önnudóttir, a political scientist, has stated to Morgunblaðið that “[i]t would be very controversial and very difficult. If it had not come to this contest for leadership, then I would think that it would have been almost impossible. Guðlaugur Þór has such strong support in the party that I believe that there would be severe political consequences to remove-ing him as a minister.”  The Independence Party National Convention will convene next Saturday, November 5.  ",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

554,Iceland Review,Leadership of Independence Party to be Contested?,2022/10/28,"This week, Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson confirmed that he is considering his candidacy for Chair of Iceland’s Independence Party – at the party’s National Convention next weekend. Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, who has served as the leader of the Icelandic Independence Party since 2009, has stated that it would be “unusual to change the party leadership” when so little time has elapsed since the formation of a new coalition government. Iceland’s Independence Party was formed in 1929 through a merger of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. The party has won the largest share of the vote in every election except 2009 (when it fell behind the Social Democratic Alliance). Furthermore, every Independence Party leader has at some point held the office of Prime Minister. Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, has served as the leader of the Icelandic Independence Party since 2009. The party commonly hosts its National Convention every two years. Owing to the pandemic, however, the Independence Party has not held a National Convention for four and a half years. In the run-up to this year’s convention, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson – who first became involved with the Independence Party in 1987 when he was elected to the board of the National Youth Organisation – surprised not a few party members, and ordinary citizens alike, by confirming that he was considering running against Chairman Bjarni. Speaking to RÚV yesterday, Guðlaugur voiced his concern for the state of the party: “Many have encouraged me to run. Their message is always the same: they’re worried about the state of the party. They – and this goes for me, too – don’t accept our current position … and without the necessary support, it will be more difficult for us to implement our policy and our ideals.” According to RÚV’s sources, Guðlaugur has entertained the notion of running for Chairman “for some time … having privately and publicly laid the foundation for his candidacy by ensuring that his supporters hold the reins in certain key positions that allocate seats at the National Convention. Meanwhile, Bjarni has focused his attention on the state finances during troubling times.” Approximately 2,000 party members will be offered seats at the Convention, who would then be eligible to vote in the event that Guðlaugur decided to throw his hat in the ring. Writing for RÚV, reporter María Sigrún Hilmarsdóttir, citing aforementioned sources, states that Guðlaugur Þór is aware that he’s got “one shot in the gun,” so to speak, and that now may be the time; Guðlaugur Þór defeated Minister Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir during the Independence Party’s primary elections in Reykjavík last summer, and if Guðlaugur Þór fails to announce now, it would be “a sign of weakness and a lack of courage.” Supporters of Chairman Bjarni Benediktsson are “prepared for the fight,” according to RÚV’s sources. Some of them are, however, surprised that Guðlaugur hadn’t taken “more conventional routes” in declaring his candidacy: announcing his intentions sooner and embarking on a “nationwide campaign of meetings to gather support and shore up his position.” Bjarni’s supporters also maintain that the current Chairman has yet to reach his prime – and that his best years are still ahead of him. They also note that “any talk of loss of popular support is empty given that the political landscape has altered beyond recognition over the past years … given that 10 parties are now in the running.” Bjarni’s supporters also note – as Bjarni himself has noted – that the Chairman enjoys much greater support among his constituency compared to Guðlaugur.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
555,Iceland Review,The Climate Disaster Has “Already Begun to Materialise”,2022/10/28,"The international community is “falling far short of the Paris goals,” a new UN report finds. “The disaster has already begun to materialise,” Halldór Þorgeirsson, Chair of Iceland’s Climate Council, told RÚV yesterday. Yesterday, October 27, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) published its 2022 edition of the Emissions Gap report. The report provides an update on the progress towards “achieving national mitigation pledges” and the goals set by the Paris Agreement by taking stock of the so-called “emissions gap.” As noted by a UN press release, the report concludes that the international community is “falling far short of the Paris goals, with no credible pathway to 1.5°C in place.” The authors state that the only way to avoid climate disaster is via an urgent “system-wide transformation.” Read More: The Age of Eco-Anxiety “Global and national climate commitments are falling pitifully short,” Secretary General of the UN António Guterres stated in a video message during an introduction of the report yesterday. “We must close the emissions gap before climate catastrophe closes in on us all.” To address the report’s findings, RÚV invited the Chair of Iceland’s Climate Council Halldór Þorgeirsson (and a retired Senior Director at the UN Climate Change Secretariat) to an interview during yesterday’s nightly news. Halldór was blunt: “These disasters have already begun to materialise, and this year, we have seen disasters that are truly man-made. The strongest example being Pakistan, and, just as bad, and nearer to home, Florida. “These things are already manifesting in such a way that it’s no longer a question of the future. Our meagre achievements means that the window of opportunity grows ever narrower; there’s much less time. That’s why the only feasible path forward is to undertake fast and extensive system-wide transformation.” The only way to do this, Halldór maintained, was increased investment. “These are large figures but in reality, it’s only about 2% of the total budget. So it certainly seems doable. Central banks play a big role, and we need to rethink the economy. That’s what this is about – alongside greater cooperation between nations.” The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) will be held from November 6 to 18 in Egypt. It will mark the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference. According to Halldór, no “big decisions” are expected to be made during the conference. “This conference will focus more on following through with the agreement,” Halldór observed. “The implementation of the Paris Agreement was concluded in Glasgow last year. During the first two days of the conference, global leaders will be present, and the messages that they send matter. All eyes will be on China. They’ve been quite reticent. Then there’s this very strong undercurrent, connected to those aforementioned disasters because one of the big questions of this conference is how we provide aid to nations who suffer such disasters.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
556,Iceland Review,Iceland Among Nations to Boycott Vote on South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary,2022/10/23,"Iceland’s delegation to a meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) joined 14 other nations in walking out on a vote on whether to establish a whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic, Vísir reports. The mass walkout took place at the end of Friday’s session and meant that there were not enough member nations present to vote on the initiative. The Icelandic government has since commented on the walkout, saying that it objected to the vote on grounds of protocol and fairness to absent member states. A proposal to establish a whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic has been circulating amongst members of the IWC for years—20 years, according to a representative of Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) Germany. The #IWC68 chair has closed the discussion on the proposal for the South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary to #IWC69 in 2024. This is a huge shame considering that the Sanctuary was proposed 20 years ago.#StopWhaling #SaveTheWhaleSaveTheWorld pic.twitter.com/I5DQWuByQe — Whale and Dolphin Conservation (Deutschland) (@WDC_Deutschland) October 20, 2022  A simple majority of the IWC member states has already voted in support of the proposal, but a 3/4 majority is needed to ratify it. “Pro-whaling nations…holding Commission hostage” Iceland’s delegation to the IWC consists of four delegates, including one representative each from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute. The fourth representative is Kristján Loftsson, CEO of the whaling company, Hvalur, hf. A recap of the Friday meeting on the IWC website described it as “challenging,” starting, on a more positive note, with the fact that it “ended with a consensus Resolution on Marine Plastics” which “highlights the transboundary nature of the threat and need for collaboration at international and multi-disciplinary levels.” Transboundary collaboration was stymied at the next agenda item, however, although the IWC recap struck a rather diplomatic tone when describing it: “Absence of some governments from the room and subsequent debate regarding quorum and handling of the Schedule Amendment on the South Atlantic Sanctuary prevented a vote taking place and resulted in Commission agreement to develop proposals to clarify the rules related to quorum and attendance. This will be the first agenda item at the next meeting in 2024 and will be discussed before the Commission is asked to take any decisions.” Matt Collins, the president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), was more vocal in his critique of the proceedings, however, tweeting: breaking news: pro-whaling nations at #IWC68 refuse to join sessions, breaking quorum required for any decision-making. This is all because they fear losing a vote on establishing a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary (where none of them hunt or want to hunt whales) — Matt Collis (@MattCollisIFAW) October 20, 2022  “breaking news: pro-whaling nations at #IWC68 refuse to join sessions, breaking quorum required for any decision-making. This is all because they fear losing a vote on establishing a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary (where none of them hunt or want to hunt whales)” According to Collins’ later tweets, Iceland joined 14 other nations in the walkout: Antigua & Barbuda, Benin, Cambodia, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Iceland, Kiribati, Laos, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nauru Palau, St. Lucia, and the Solomon Islands. The meeting chair elected to adjourn for lunch to see if the absent nations would return, but none of them did. “Same countries still absent, holding the Commission hostage…” tweeted Collins, a state of affairs that continued even after a second adjournment and “passionate pleas from Latin American countries for those absent to show respect to those who have remained.” we're back in session at#IWC68 but no change in status. Same countries still absent, holding the Commission hostage… — Matt Collis (@MattCollisIFAW) October 20, 2022  Ministry says Iceland objected out of fairness to absent members, protocol
 Dúi Landmark, the PR officer for the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, confirmed that the Icelandic delegation walked out of the South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary vote. In a written statement issued to the media about the incident, the Ministry stated that fewer than two out of three IWC member states were present at this year’s meeting in Portoroz, Slovenia, for a variety of reasons. The statement noted that it was the opinion of representatives of developing nations in Africa and island nations in the Caribbean that a vote should not be held under such circumstances. A number of present nations tried to proceed with the vote, but the Icelandic government agreed with the objectors, saying that holding a vote would be a breach of protocol according to the IWC’s Articles of Association. “Consequently, Iceland believes that it would be irregular to vote on such a proposal when the requirements of the [IWC’s] Articles of Association have not been fulfilled and a number of member states are unable to substantively comment on the proposal in question through participation in, and discussions at the annual meeting,” concluded the Ministry’s response. The vote on the South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary will be the first agenda item at next year’s meeting of the International Whaling Commission.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
557,Iceland Review,Bill to Amend Foreign Nationals Act Distributed Among MP’s,2022/10/21,"Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson distributed his bill to amend the Foreign Nationals Act among members of Parliament today. If passed into law, the bill would, among other things, strip asylum seekers of their rights 30 days after their applications have been rejected. Last spring, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson announced his intention of submitting a bill to Parliament that would amend the Foreign Nationals Act. The Foreign National Act concerns the “authorisation of foreign nationals to enter Iceland, their stay in the country, and their right to international protection.” Earlier this month, Jón observed that the government was facing a “difficult situation” when it came to asylum seekers in Iceland. He maintained that the welfare system was unable to cope with increased demand and that it was his hope that the new bill would help to solve “certain problems.” As noted by RÚV, a record number of individuals (2,500) have applied for international protection in Iceland this year. Speaking to RÚV, Jón maintained that it was the “government’s duty” to establish a closed facility for asylum seekers whose applications for international protection had been rejected. “This means that individuals are placed in particular housing, with limited access, limited freedom to travel, while they wait to be deported.” Jón added: “We’re dealing with a specific problem when it comes to deportations, namely that we’re unable to reach certain individuals, we don’t know where they are, or whether they’ve left the country.” The minister’s rhetoric inspired immediate criticism from members of the Pirate and Reform parties, among others, who accused Jón of stoking fear with “vague claims and assertions” about asylum seekers. PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir, who leads the cabinet to which Jón Gunnarsson belongs, stated that she disagreed with the Minister of Justice’s assertion that “chaos reigned” in matters relating to asylum seekers in Iceland. Addressing Parliament, Katrín remarked that the situation in Iceland was merely a reflection of unprecedented times and the offshoot of two governmental decisions in Iceland, namely to receive a greater number of refugees from Ukraine and Venezuela. This morning, the Minister’s bill was distributed among members of Parliament. It marked the fifth time that such an amendment was submitted to Parliament. As noted by RÚV, the bill stipulates that the rights of a foreign national (the right to housing, healthcare, etc.) whose application for international protection has been rejected be stripped 30 days after said rejection. This would, according to the authors’ rationale, prevent individuals from seeking services, even for years on end, after they’ve been made to leave the country. If passed into law, asylum seekers would “no longer have access to healthcare or schools; however, the rights of children; parents or custodians; pregnant women; or disabled individuals with long-term support needs cannot be revoked.” To review the bill in Icelandic, click here.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
558,Iceland Review,Strætó Discontinues Night-Time Service During Weekends,2022/10/18,"Strætó has announced that it will discontinue its night-time bus service in Reykjavík during the weekends, citing low passenger demand during a special trial period. Strætó is facing financial troubles following the pandemic, and recently, the capital area municipalities had to divert extra fund to keep the regional partnership company from insolvency. In early July, Strætó (the public bus service in Iceland) announced that the Reykjavík night bus, Næturstrætó, would return to service on July 9 following a two-year hiatus in response to low demand during the pandemic. During this hiatus, many capital-area residents had called for its return, arguing that it provided an affordable and safe alternative to taxis. During a trial run between July and October of this year, however – when the night bus departed downtown Reykjavík every hour and stopped at the capital area’s seven suburban neighbourhoods – demand once again proved wanting. As noted in a press release from Strætó, an average of 15 passengers travelled aboard the night bus during each trip, which amounts to approximately 300 passengers over a weekend. “In light of this, and given the finances, Strætó’s board has agreed that continuing night-time service during the weekends, now that the trial period has concluded, cannot be justified. The service will, therefore, be discontinued.” As noted by Vísir, transportation options from downtown Reykjavík after the night clubs have closed during the weekend are limited; operating electric scooters while intoxicated is illegal and securing transportation via taxis often proves difficult.  ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
559,Iceland Review,Would-Be Terrorists Discussed Killing Minister Guðlaugur Þór,2022/10/18,"The two men being held in police custody accused of planning a domestic terrorism attack in Iceland had reportedly discussed killing Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson – Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. Last Friday, the District Court of Reykjavík approved the District Attorney’s request to extend their custody by four weeks. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had reportedly discussed carrying out an attack during the police’s annual celebration (which was held on October 1). Yesterday, RÚV reported that the suspects had also discussed killing Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate. The Chief of Police reportedly notified the Minister of the suspects’ intentions prior to calling the Minister in for questioning. As reported on October 10, the suspects had also discussed targeting Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir and Gunnar Smári Egilsson, chairperson of the Socialist Party. The names of current and former Pirate Party politicians were also mentioned as possible targets. The police have asked a psychiatrist to assess the earnestness of the remarks made by the men during private messages, with the suspects’ lawyers contending that the threats were empty. Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson has stated that this is the “first investigation of its kind” to be launched in Iceland.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
560,Iceland Review,VR to Remain in ASÍ,2022/10/17,"Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairperson of VR, has stated that for the time being, VR’s position within ASÍ will remain unchanged. VR is Iceland’s largest trade union, representing some 40,000 workers. There have however been suggestions recently that VR will leave ASÍ, or the Federation of Labour. ASÍ, founded in 1916, is the largest federation of trade unions in Iceland and has historically played an important role in labour organisation in Iceland. However, the most recent ASÍ conference over contract negotiations has proved a turbulent one, with many major trade unions suggesting that they go their separate ways in the future. The upheavals come in the wake of Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year from her leadership position in ASÍ. Citing political hostility, she said that it was no longer possible to perform her duties in her resignation letter. Since her resignation, ASÍ leadership has been in turmoil, with some of Iceland’s largest trade unions considering leaving during ASÍ’s 45th conference. Ragnar Þór also withdrew his candidacy for ASÍ leadership at the conference, citing the possibility of a break with the federation. Now, at least for the time being, it seems that VR will remain with ASÍ. The announcement came today before a formal meeting with SA, Iceland’s leading employers’ union. In a statement from Ragnar Þór, he said that all of the union’s efforts will now be directed towards the wage negotiations with SA. Regarding the future, however, Ragnar Þór emphasised that nothing can be ruled out.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
561,Iceland Review,"“The task is massive,” PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir tells Arctic Council",2022/10/14,"Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir addressed the audience at the Arctic Circle conference yesterday. In her speech, Katrín warned that if sufficient action wasn’t taken today, the arctic could “become unrecognisable” in the future. The Arctic Circle is a nonprofit and nonpartisan organisation founded by former President of Iceland Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, former publisher Alice Rogoff, and former Premier of Greenland Kuupik Kleist, among others. The organisation aims to facilitate dialogue between governments, organisations, corporations, universities, think tanks, environmental associations, indigenous communities, concerned citizens, and other stakeholders to address issues facing the Arctic as a result of climate change and melting sea ice. During the opening of the 2022 Arctic Circle Assembly yesterday, October 13, at the Harpa Conference Hall in Reykjavík, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir addressed the audience. Katrín began her speech on a note of positivity, acknowledging the “broad political determination” to protect the Arctic and capitalise on present opportunities: “On the positive side, we see expanding scientific networks, greater knowledge with both the public and businesses and growing skills, there is more investment in green technology, and we are witnessing various green solutions emerging.” However, Katrín noted, the Arctic could become “unrecognisable in a few decades” if further decisive action was not taken. “Everything is changing – we see more extreme weathers around the globe – only in the last two weeks we saw hundreds of trees here in Iceland being ripped up by their roots because of extreme storms in the eastern part of the country. We see glaciers receding, permafrost is melting, heat records are beaten and forests are burning. And all this is happening much faster in the Arctic – where the ecosystem is sensitive and the resources are great.” Some of these resources, Katrín noted, should not be meddled with: “We see big business and big countries showing more and more interest in the Arctic – not least because of its rich resources which should not all be harnessed. I applaud the decision of the government of Greenland not to drill for oil – my government has also declared that we will not issue licences for oil exploration in Iceland’s exclusive economic zone and this will be put into legislation.” Alongside addressing climate-related issues in the Arctic, Katrín also turned her attention to the war in Ukraine and the exclusion of Russia from the Council: “Our region is directly affected as the aggressor is an important player in the Arctic with legitimate interests. But Russia’s illegitimate actions made it impossible for us not to respond and they were rightly excluded from the Arctic Council. From day one Iceland has condemned Russia’s aggression in the strongest possible way. Iceland has solidly supported Ukraine, and we will continue to do so, together with our Nordic, European, US, and Canadian friends.” Katrín concluded her speech with a nod to the massiveness of the task lying ahead: “This room is full of hope and concerns for the future of the Arctic. We represent different interests, different politics, different ideas. But we should all be united in the will to protect the Arctic and provide a sustainable future for the local populations in the area, as well as for our ecosystems. The task is massive, but the solutions exist, it is ours to get the job done.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
562,Iceland Review,Foreign Nationals to Receive Icelandic Citizenship after Controversial Withholding of Applications,2022/10/13,"RÚV reports that six foreign citizens are to be naturalised as Icelandic citizens following a delay that was caused by the Directorate of Immigration withholding their applications. The six new Icelanders are respectively from Mongolia, Russia, South Africa, Kosovo, and Iran. In addition to the normal process of receiving citizenship through residence and application, parliament can also grant citizenship through decree in Iceland. These special applications are generally for individuals in extenuating circumstances, though some critics such as Bjarni Benediktsson have stated that these special applications constitute too large a proportion of Icelandic naturalisations. These citizenship applications through decree are still processed by the Directorate of Immigration, however, and there was controversy when earlier in the year, the Directorate refused to hand over the relevant application to parliament. Notably, this deliberate withholding was illegal, and caused outcry among politicians who insisted that legal process be followed. Now, the relevant application have finally been submitted and the path has been cleared to Icelandic citizenship for the six. Parliament generally naturalises Icelandic citizens twice a year: at the end of the year and before summer break.    ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

At the 45th conference of ASÍ, Iceland’s Federation of Labour, tensions have run high, with accusations of personal attacks and more leading to uncertainty for the future of ASÍ’s leadership. The tensions take place in the wake of Drífa Snædal’s, former chairperson of the ASÍ board, resignation earlier this year. Among the reasons for her resignation she cited that personal conflicts had escalated to the point where it was no longer possible for her to perform her job. In addition to their candidacies for leadership being withdrawn, they have also stated that they are now considering withdrawing their unions from ASÍ itself. Both Sólveig and Ragnar have stressed in statements that the final decision will be decided among the unions themselves. The Federation of Labour, founded in 1916, has been the major power in organised labour in Iceland since its founding. Should Efling and VR, Iceland’s two largest trade unions, leave ASÍ, it would represent a historic change in Icelandic labour relations. Ólöf Helga Adolfsdóttir, secretary of the board of Efling, had previously announced her candidacy against Ragnar Þór for ASÍ president.

President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson awarded the Icelandic Literary Prize, as well as the prize for best crime thriller, known as the “Blood Drop” award, the best non-fiction, and the best youth literature. This year’s recipient of the Icelandic Literary Prize is Pedro Gunnlaugur Garcia for his novel, Lungu (Lungs), published by Bjartur. According to the verdict by the award panel, “Lungu is a sweeping family history of many generations from different corners of the world, which plays out in contemporary Iceland, but also stretches far into the future, culminating in a virtual reality where these generations mingle. Here, a new tone is struck in Icelandic fiction writing with a magical narrative that effortlessly and smoothly moves between the deepest emotions and conflicts to adventurous moments of joy with a mythical twist – so that even the greatest tragedies benefit from the joy. Relationships between lovers and generations are broken and damaged, but stories and memories illuminate fateful moments in their lives, showing the reader the very spark of life, and capturing the essence of a long life,” says the jury’s review. At the ceremony, Pedro Gunnlaugur Garcia stated: “It is gratifying, strange, and frankly overwhelming that the book has reached readers, touched some people, and now won an award. I didn’t expect this at all; it was a distant dream at best.” Other recipients this year included Skúli Sigurðsson for his crime thriller Stóri Bróðir (Big Brother), Arndís Þórarinsdóttir for her children’s book Kollhnís (Somersault), and Ragnar Stefánsson for his non-fiction Hvenær kemur sá stóri: Að spá fyrir um jarðskjálfta (When Is the Big One Coming: Predicting Earthquakes).

569,Iceland Review,FÚSK Art Collective Looks for New Home,2023/01/17,"DIY art collective, FÚSK, is on the look for a new home.  Gufunes, a former industrial area near the capital, has for some years been the location of film production company Reykjavík Studios, in addition to several other art projects and collectives. The City of Reykjavík has offered abandoned industrial facilities at the site to artists and creative workers who would like to develop them into studios and workspaces. However, despite the initial welcome art projects have received in this area, many are now being forced to relocate. FÚSK leases a de-commissioned fertilizer factory from the City of Reykavík. In a public statement on social media, FÚSK members pointed out unfavourable leasing conditions from the City of Reykjavík, in addition to increasing restrictions. FÚSK has, for instance, been restricted from working with the film industry and from holding further events. Elsa Jónsdóttir, a co-founder of FÚSK, stated: “We went into FÚSK not having anything, water, electricity, or plumbing. It made every 100 per cent harder, but we also learned a lot. I became so invested in some of the projects we had in Gufunes, I just hope the city fights to keep some of them alive.” Elsa also praised the city for some of its support for artists during the COVID-19 pandemic but suggested a lack of planning. “We saw all this support for artists during COVID,” she said. “But once it was over, they just pulled out the rug from under us. I don’t think there was a very long-term plan. Even though the city has tried to support youth culture and the arts through initiatives, we don’t always see it in practice.” The future of FÚSK is still very much up in the air, but organizers have stated their openness to many different possibilities, including a possible relocation to the countryside. The Gufunes area is slated for an urban renewal project, with plans to construct a swimming pool, a preschool, steam baths, and an underwater restaurant.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
570,Iceland Review,Þorrablót Feasts Return After Two-Year Hiatus,2023/01/14,"After a two-year hiatus during COVID, 2023 marks the return of Þorrablót, a midwinter feast inspired by the food traditions and pagan celebrations of medieval Iceland. Demand is expected to be high over the coming weeks and local food producers are scrambling to prepare. RÚV reports that Icelanders are projected to eat some 60 tons of traditional þorrablót fare, which ranges, on the more appetizing end of the spectrum, from hangikjöt, or smoked lamb, to soured meats that have been pickled in whey. A not-so-ancient festival Þorrablót coincides with the old Norse month of Þorri, which this year, begins on January 21 and continues through February 18. But while the feast does have its roots in ancient tradition, “…there is really nothing that connects [that tradition] to the present-day feasts of the same name,” food historian Nanna Rögnvaldadóttir writes in Icelandic Food and Cookery. Instead, Nanna explains, the festival was largely the creation of “…a restaurant owner in Reykjavík in the late 1950s—he thought there might be a market for the disappearing traditional Icelandic foods that had never been served in restaurants before.” A traditional Þorrablót spread includes hangokjöt, or smoked lamb, as well as a variety of preserved sour dishes, or súrmatur. Súrmatur, as Eygló Svala Arnarsdóttir explains, “includes soured blood and liver pudding, ram testicles, sheep-head jelly, brisket and lundabaggi, a roll of secondary meats. Also eaten at Þorrablót is putrefied shark and buttered dried fish. A traditional type of bread served alongside the Þorri dinner is flatkaka, a special Icelandic rye flatbread.” Pickling prep started in August Þorrablót is typically celebrated with large, buffet-style feasts. Workplaces, cultural associations, and villages all host their own, well-attended festivities, something that was obviously not possible during COVID. This changed the way that þorramatur (food for þorrablót) was packaged and sold over the last few years, namely that stores began selling single-serving, pre-portioned þorrablót plates that could be eaten at home. These TV-dinner-style plates proved popular and will still be sold this year, but there’s also a resurgence in demand for þorramatur in banquet-ready quantities. This means that local meat processing companies like Norðlenska have their hands full for the next few weeks. Andrés Vilhjálmsson, marketing director for Norðlenska, says that he fully expects that some popular þorrablót products will sell out this year. Þorrablót is a feast of all the food that survived the winter, primarily meat and fish that has been dried, salted, smoked, soured, pickled, or cured. What this means in practical terms for producers today is that preparations had to start all the way back in August. “There really are a lot of steps,” affirmed Norðlenska’s quality control officer, Bára Eyfjörð Heimisdóttir. “You have to boil food down, which is tricky, you have to pickle it in whey, and you need to have good whey and monitor that whey closely. So we’ve been working hard.” Something sour is a relief after all that Christmas candy Þorramatur is not for the faint of stomach, but Bára nevertheless finds the season’s sour spreads refreshing after all the sweetness of the Christmas holidays. By February, she says, Icelanders are “all trying to get moving, to get away from all the sugar and carbs and shift completely to protein. And that’s where soured foods and all this þorramatur scores high.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
571,Iceland Review,Prime Minister’s Crime Thriller Number 1 Book in Iceland,2023/01/03,"According to bookseller Penninn Eymnundsson, Reykjavík: A Crime Thriller, was the best-selling book in Iceland in 2022.

Local children also did their part by selling their own artwork and Christmas cards during the auction and raised ISK 36,000 [$254; €239] for the cause. “We reached our goal, which was to cover the bills that we already owe in connection with the help we’ve been providing children of late,” said co-founder Esther Þorvaldsdóttir. Saturday’s weather discouraged the happenstance foot traffic that the auction might have otherwise enjoyed given the venue’s central location, but there was still a fair turnout from local art collectors who’d been hoping to add to their collections. A group of tourists were also invited in to come in, enjoy the art, and warm themselves from the cold. The auction included musical performances from Sigríður Thorlacius and Guðmundur Óskar, as well as author and artist Hallgrímur Helgason’s recitation of a poem he wrote for the occasion. Hallgrímur was also among the artists whose work was sold at the auction. Úlfur Karlsson, Sunna Ben, GAGA SKORRDAL, Hugleikur Dagsson, Þrándur Þórarinsson, Þorvaldur Jónsson, and Lu Hong also offered work for auction. There was also an original Pippi Longstocking drawing that artist Marit Törnqvist originally made for author Astrid Lindgren. Not all of the artworks on offer sold at the auction, so any would-be art collectors who want to support a good cause can still make a bid on the organization’s art auction website.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

Tár received three nominations in other categories. Notable darlings of the Globes this year include The Banchees of Inisherin, which received the most nominations, or eight; Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Fabelmans, and Babylon. Women Talking tells the story of eight women hailing from an isolated Mennonite colony. Following revelations that men from their community had drugged and raped women in the community at night for years, the protagonists are forced to grapple with reconciling their reality with their faith. Speaking to a journalist from the Credits – the Motion Picture Association’s online magazine – Hildur stated that the film’s producers had decided to hire trauma specialists for the actors in light of the “hugely sensitive” and emotional subject matter. The music in the film, Hildur notes, serves as a vehicle for hope: “For this narrative, the music needed to really be a vehicle of hope and forward movement, to give us the courage to keep on moving, and to bring everyone together into these discussions and this decision-making of what to do. The music needed to draw us to them and give us a connection and a sense of community.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

580,Iceland Review,A Third of Icelanders Read Daily,2022/11/17,"A new report from the Icelandic Literature Center has shed new and interesting light on the reading habits of Icelanders. The annual study has been carried out since 2017. On average, Icelanders listen to 2.4 books per month, with 32% of the nation reading at least once a day. However, Icelandic readership is undergoing a notable shift, with both the groups of those who never read and those who “binge read” growing. The study also reported a marked difference between the genders, with women reading significantly more than men. The gender gap also correlates with a gap in education, with the college-educated generally reading more than those with a secondary level of education. Older people were found to read on average more than younger people, with the youngest group polled, those between 18 and 24, reading the least out of all groups. In a comparison between the capital region and Iceland’s countryside, no significant difference was recorded. Some 65% of Icelanders read either exclusively or mostly in Icelandic. This represents a slight change from last year, when the figure sat at 58%. 18% of those polled read equally in Icelandic and another language, with another 14% of residents reading more often in another language than Icelandic. Finally, 3% of those polled read exclusively in another language. The language difference also breaks down along age, with those 34 and younger generally reading in other languages more often than the older groups polled. Usage of public library resources was also recorded, with women again using the library more often than men. Among the top users of public libraries were households with two or more children. The report, which can be read in full here, was authored in cooperation with the Reykjavík City Library, Association of Icelandic Publishers, Hagþenkir, the National and University Library of Iceland, Reykjavík UNSECO City of Literature, and the Writers’ Union of Iceland.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

The members of Sigur Rós were first charged with tax evasion in 2019 for failing to correctly declare income. Throughout the case, the band have stated that they acted in good faith, submitting their tax income to an accountant who mishandled them. Although charges have been cleared against three other members of Sigur Rós for their personal tax statements, the case against Jónsi has centred around both his personal tax statements and those of his company, Frakkur. According to a statement by Einar Tryggvason, prosecutor at the State Prosecutor’s Office, an acquittal is being sought in the case of Jón Þór’s personal taxes, but the charges relating to Frakkur still stand. The charges relate to taxes filed between 2010 and 2014, and could represent up to ISK 146 million (USD 1,002,000; EUR 996,000) of unpaid taxes. In connection with the case, several properties and vehicles belonging to Jónsi have been seized. The case against the band was dismissed in May of last year, but an appellate court has since overruled the dismissal. Representatives of the band have been critical of the proceedings and of Icelandic law, saying that Jónsi has now been tried twice for the same crime.

The National Library of Icelandic is not interested, leaving the future of the unique archive in question. In a statement to Fréttablaðið, Benedikt Hjartarson, board member of the Esperanto Association, stated that “the collection is an important part of the history of internationalism in Iceland.” Esperanto is a constructed language, created in the late 19th century as an international auxiliary language. It is the world’s most widely spoken constructed language, having an active speech community in the thousands. The collection, according to Benedikt, consists of around 6,000 Esperanto-language books, newspapers, and other publications from various countries. The Esperanto Association no longer has the ability to take care of this collection, having recently sold its downtown property, the former home of the archive. The Esperanto Association had hoped that the National Library of Iceland would be interested in the collection, making the material even more accessible to the public than previously. “Perhaps the strangest answer we got is that there has been so little interest in these books. This is correct, in a sense, but it’s also precisely the reason why it’s so important to preserve such a collection,” stated Benedikt. Benedikt also explained that the collection is important to research on Esperanto-related topics, and he highlighted the ways in which Esperanto has been connected to other historical movements, such as various left political movements. With the Esperanto Society soon having to hand over ownership of its former property, the future of the collection is still unclear. “But we don’t intend to just put it all in a storage container in the meantime,” stated Benedikt.  ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

586,Iceland Review,Archaeologists Unearth Cottage Between Reykjavík and Mosfellsbær,2022/10/27,"Archaeologists have unearthed a cottage near Úlfarsfell, a mountain and popular walking area between Reykjavík and Mosfellsbær. The discovery was made during exploratory excavations made preceding the construction of shopping centre. According to Icelandic law, an archaeological investigation must be conducted before construction and any finds registered with the Cultural Heritage Agency of Iceland. The cottage in question, called Hamrahlíð, was found to have been inhabited from around 1850 to 1920. Among the everyday objects found include a knife, pottery, plates, cups, glass bottles, and some agricultural tools. Archaeologist from Antikva ehf., the contractor responsible for the excavation, stated to RÚV that: “We’ve found cooking pits, so people were cooking something here or working with food. We don’t have any mounds or any built-up fireplaces, but we do have these holes. In one, which is 35 cm deep, we have at least six layers of moss and with burnt bones and charcoal. It can be seen very clearly on the floors that they busied themselves around this area.” Hermann Jakob Hjartarson, archaeologist at Antikva, has stated that relatively few studies of such small cottages have been carried out. He stated to RÚV that, “undoubtedly, I think that this is still just one part of a bigger story. Most people here at that time were just cottage farmers.”  ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

588,Iceland Review,Icelandic to Take Precedence on Keflavík Airport Signage,2022/10/14,"The board of directors at Isavia, the national airport and air navigation service provider of Iceland, has decided to renew the signage at Keflavík Airport so as to emphasise the Icelandic language; Isavia will foreground Icelandic on all instructional and informational signs at the airport. The Icelandic Language Council was established in 1964 and operates according to Article 6 of Law No. 61/2011 regarding the status of the Icelandic language and Icelandic sign language: “The role of the Icelandic Language Council shall be to provide public authorities with academically-informed advice on matters concerning the Icelandic language, and to make proposals to the Minister regarding language policy.” The law also stipulates that the Council may “take the initiative to draw attention to both positive and negative aspects of the ways in which the Icelandic language is used in the public sphere.” With a view to this provision of the law, the Icelandic Language Council has persistently drawn attention to the conspicuously anglicised signage at the Keflavík National Airport: “English is the primary language on almost all of the signs at the airport,” a journalist at RÚV writes, “with information in Icelandic playing a secondary role or none at all.” Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Professor Emeritus at the University of Iceland, brought attention to the issue again after Icelandair announced that it would resume the custom of addressing passengers in Icelandic first, prior to reverting to other languages. Isavia responded with reference to security concerns, but critics pushed back, noting that local languages were foregrounded in many international airports without such a thing being a cause of concern; Gaelic is foregrounded at Irish airports ahead of English. An article on Mbl.is notes that Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Culture and Business Affairs, emphasised these concerns to the Board of Directors of Isavia, the national airport and air navigation service provider of Iceland. According to Mbl.is, Lilja had “commented on the marginalisation of the Icelandic language at the airport at the time before reemphasising her concerns following Icelandair’s decision.” Lilja reached out to former minister Kristján Þór Júlíusson, the newly-elected Chairman of the Board for Isavia, who then raised the issue at a board meeting (see below entry: “Concerns have been raised, and comments made, in public, by, among other parties, the board of the Icelandic Language Council in 2016 and 2017, regarding the use of language on informational and instructional signs at the Keflavík Airport.

590,Iceland Review,Rising Prices Likely to Affect Christmas Book Market,2022/09/28,"Inflation and the energy crisis in Europe are driving up prices for many consumer goods, and Christmas books are likely to be no exception this year. Books are a traditional and popular Christmas gift in Iceland, so much so that the months preceding Christmas see a “jólabókaflóð,” or flood of Christmas books. The tradition is said to have originated during the Second World War, when products from Europe became scarcer. Books were largely printed locally and were seen as cheap and easily available Christmas gifts. In a statement to RÚV, chairman of the Association of Icelandic Book Publishers Heiðar Ingi Svansson stated that the industry hopes to avoid price increases as much as possible, but that some increases will be inevitable. Heiðar outlined the factors contributing to rising costs: “the main ones are that the energy crisis in Europe is causing an increase in energy prices for the production of paper. In recent years, the supply of paper for book printing has also decreased due to the greater focus of paper manufacturers on producing paper for packaging production, due to the increase in online sales.” Despite the energy crisis and rising costs, Heiðar says that the Icelandic publishing industry must still largely rely on Northern Europe for its needs. “The increase in transportation costs around the world and the fact that the state’s reimbursement of part of the production costs is limited to printing in Europe means that it is not possible for publishers to print books elsewhere in the world,” Heiðar stated. “Also, environmental considerations, including the carbon footprint, play a major role.” Another factor keeping Icelandic publishing in Europe, and especially Germany, is the increasing time frame for printing books. Years ago, when paper was cheaper, publishers kept large stocks of paper. Now with increasing shift in logistics to “just in time” manufacturing, publishers tend to keep increasingly small stocks of paper, meaning that supplies have to be specially ordered for each print run. This means increased time between when the book is sent off to print and when it hits shelves. As a result of this, Icelandic book publishers are keen to keep the printing process as close to Iceland as possible to ensure on-time delivery. Despite the bleak holiday forecast, Heiðar stated that “we are going to do everything in our power to hold back price increases on books before Christmas. The Christmas book is by far the most popular Christmas gift for Icelanders, and we plan to do everything we can to ensure that it remains so.”  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
591,Iceland Review,New Grímsey Church Hosts First Service After Fire,2022/09/27,"The first service was celebrated in the new Grímsey church this Sunday, in a major milestone for the reconstruction. The historic church, built out of driftwood in 1867 and relocated in 1932, burned to the ground last year in a fire. Although no one was injured, the destruction of the church was a significant loss for the small community. The new church has been designed to reference the historical structure, but also to accommodate the modern needs of the community, including use as an event space for the Grímsey islanders. In an interview with RÚV, Reverend Oddur Bjarni Þorkelsson, parish priest of Grímsey said: “It’s a huge moment. I am not often speechless, but that’s exactly how it was. This is the first time I’ve seen the building after its construction began. It’s so similar to the old church but completely different too. And to see the power of the community and the joy of everyone who came to help, this is a great moment.” The reconstruction of the church has cost an estimated ISK 120 million, with the original structure being insured for ISK 30 million. Another ISK 20 million has been funded by the state, but much of the remaining amount has had to be collected by the community themselves.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
592,Iceland Review,Supreme Court Takes Up Slayer Suit Against Secret Solstice Festival,2022/09/26,"Iceland’s Supreme Court has accepted an appeal by American thrash metal band Slayer against the organisers of the Secret Solstice festival. Slayer performed at the 2018 festival and allege that they were never paid for their performance. In a 2020 ruling, organisers of Secret Solstice were ordered by a Reykjavík district court to pay a sum of ISK 20 million (USD 138,900; EUR 143,800) to Slayer. Despite some ambiguity in communications regarding the payment, it was determined that Slayer should be compensated with the personal assets of the organisers. However, earlier this year, the decision was revisited by the National Court, which then acquitted Live Events, the former organisers. With the former organisers in bankruptcy, representatives from Slayer have claimed that assets were misused during the bankruptcy, and that there is precedent for payment obligation in such cases. After the festival’s bankruptcy, it was sold to several different legal entities. Confusion arose after public statements by one of the directors of Live Events, which claimed that all debts would be settled. Now, the Supreme Court of Iceland is taking up the case. Central to the case is whether the statement in question was general in nature, or whether it constituted a binding contract. The Supreme Court has taken up the case partly because it believes that the case will have broader importance in setting precedent in cases of payment obligation with multiple debtors.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0
593,Iceland Review,Polish Deputy Minister: Support Language Learning in Both Nations,2022/09/22,"While on an official visit to Iceland, Polish deputy minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek voiced his approval for mutual language learning in both nations. According to the deputy minister, Polish children should be able to learn their mother tongue in Iceland, but Icelandic should also be offered at a university level in Poland. Poles constitute a large portion of the immigrant population in Iceland. According to Statistics Iceland, some 20,500 Poles claimed residency in Iceland in 2021, comprising nearly 40% of the immigrant population and over 5% of the total population. As such, Poland and Iceland have a very important relationship. There are, however, fears that not all Polish immigrants have had the opportunity to properly integrate into Icelandic society. Increased language education in both countries could be a way to better integrate Polish immigrants into Icelandic society. In a public address, the deputy minister stated that Icelandic was already offered at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and that there were plans to extend Icelandic education to the University of Gdańsk. “It’s one of the things we’ve done to show that we take our relationship with Iceland very seriously,” he stated. Mr. Szynkowski vel Sek also noted the need for more Polish-Icelandic translators, saying that as the connection between the two nations has become so significant, it is important to have specialists with good command of both languages.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

Nominated in 13 categories, the folk horror film took home a total a 12 awards, including film of the year, director of the year (Valdimar Jóhannsson) and screenplay of the year (Valdimar Jóhannsson and Sjón). The Edda Prize is awarded annually by the Icelandic Film and Television Academy since 1999. Under consideration this year were 154 television works, 10 films, 13 documentaries, and 15 entries for youth media. Icelandic filmmaker Þráinn Bertelsson was also recognized for his work in cinema.

At the award ceremony, Þráinn stated: “I am extremely grateful that I somehow managed to work only on things that I was interested in. Everything I do, I do for fun and hopefully for someone else too.” Iceland’s contribution to the 2022 Oscars was also selected at the award ceremony, Berdreymi (Beautiful Beings), by director Guðmundur Arnar Guðmundsson. The film concerns a troubled teenage boy with a difficult home who befriends a bullied child at school. According to the jury, the film “is a haunting story that is presented with calmness and consideration […] The tone, spirit, and feel of the narrative exploits the potential of the form in a remarkable way, resulting in a raw and powerful cinematic experience.” Guðmundur is also known for his 2016 film, Hjartasteinn (Heartstone).

RÚV reports that this is one of the largest film and television production reimbursements that the government has ever made—on par with the ISK 500,000,000 received by Fast 8 in 2017. Two other productions, the TV series Washington Black and Stella Blomkvist, also received substantial reimbursements: ISK 217 million [$1.55 million; €1.55 million] and ISK 170 million [$1.22 million; €1.22 million], respectively.

Per the Icelandic Film Center’s reimbursement scheme, “Producers can apply for reimbursements from the State Treasury of 25% of the costs incurred in the production of films and television programs in Iceland, or 35% for production projects that meet given conditions.” Based on a true story, Against the Ice is set in 1909 and follows two men’s trek across the Greenland ice cap to recover the records of the ill-fated Denmark expedition, which set out years before to chart the geography of Greenland. Beset by troubles of their own, the pair must survive in the Arctic while waiting for rescue that may never come. The film was directed by Peter Flinth, and stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Joe Cole (Peaky Blinders).

However, the scope of the event will be slightly pulled back this year, given recent cuts in public funding to the arts. RIFF has become a centre of the film scene in Iceland is recent years, spotlighting lesser-known international directors. Despite the decline in funding, some 70 films will be featured from 59 nations. Especially prevalent this year will be short-form films, with some 207 short films featured. Additionally, a special emphasis is being placed this year on women in filmmaking, with a majority of the featured films directed by female directors. In a drive to reduce the environmental impact of RIFF, the use of printed materials such as programmes and posters will be reduced. Instead of programmes, RIFF is launching an app this year to help reduce paper waste. Movie-goers will be able to access the programme schedule, in addition to buy tickets and find other information about the screenings. Several films will be making their world premiere at this year’s RIFF, such as Icelandic director Sigurjón Sighvatsson’s Exxtinction Emergency, a documentary about the Extinction Rebellion environmental movement. RIFF has also been known for untraditional screenings, including drive-in car screenings and pool screening at Reykjavík’s swimming facilities. This year RIFF will also feature a glacial screening inside Langjökull, where Lars Ostenfeld’s documentary Into the Ice will be shown. According to a press release from RIFF, this represents “a unique opportunity to understand and perceive the power of filmmaking in the natural setting of the film’s subject.”  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

The project entails the largest-ever foreign investment in culture in Iceland’s history. Minister of Culture Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir says the project is proof that government initiatives are helping put Iceland’s film industry on the map. While it will be filmed in Iceland, the fourth season of True Detective is in fact set in Alaska, where the story follows detectives Liz Danvers (played by Jodie Foster) and Evangeline Navarro (Kali Reis) as they investigate the disappearance of six men from a research station. True Detective has received praise from critics and audiences – and won five Emmy Awards. Iceland’s government recently raised the repayment for production costs for films and TV series shot in the country from 25% to 35%. Iceland’s Culture Minister Lilja Alfreðsdóttir presented this and other initiatives to members of the film and music industry on a recent trip to Los Angeles. “I feel a lot of support here in Los Angeles with the initiatives we have been implementing in the last year or so to promote creative industries in Iceland,” Lilja stated. “The True Detective project is the largest foreign investment in the field of culture in Iceland’s history. With a clear vision and multifaceted actions, we are succeeding in making our country a highly respected partner in the world of cinema. International film companies are ready to invest in bigger, longer-term projects than they did.

598,Iceland Review,Prime Minister Pens Crime Novel with Ragnar Jónasson,2022/09/11,"Best-selling author Ragnar Jónasson and Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir have co-authored a crime novel together, RÚV reports. The book will be called Reykjavík. This may seem an unlikely detour for the Prime Minister, but Katrín actually wrote her undergraduate thesis on Icelandic crime novels. She and Ragnar have, moreover, been planning their collaboration for some time. Two years ago, Katrín mentioned that the pair would be co-authoring a book together, but COVID scuppered those plans—at least temporarily. A year ago, however, Ragnar confirmed that they’d started writing. Reykjavík is set in 1986 and deals with the disappearance of a young girl named Lára Marteinsdóttir from Víðey, a small island located in Kollafjörður Bay just off the capital’s coastline, some 30 years previous. For decades, Lára’s disappearance has weighed heavily on the Icelandic nation, but no concrete explanation of her disappearance has ever been furnished. That is, until a young reporter starts digging into the cold case with startling consequences. “In this story, Katrín Jakobsdóttir and I are going to invite readers on a journey back to the summer when Reykjavík celebrated its 200th birthday, when Bylgjan and Stöð 2 [Iceland’s first privately-owned radio and TV stations] first started broadcasting, and Reagan and Gorbachev’s Reykjavík Summit was just around the corner,” wrote Ragnar in a Facebook post about the book on Friday. “And that summer is also when unexpected clues about Lára’s fate come to light.” Reykjavík is set to be released in Iceland on October 25.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
599,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Art Shows Cancelled Over Noise Complaints,2022/09/07,"An art and concert venue in Skerjafjörður has been forced by city authorities to cease holding events after persistent noise complaints from local residents, reports Vísir. The venue, called Tóma Rýmið, or Empty Space, is managed by the art collective, Klúbburinn. The collective leased the space from the City of Reykjavík through the art initiative Skapandi Borg, which seeks to promote the arts in Reykjavík. According to the group, it was understood at the time of signing that the space would be used for concerts. As such, they claim it is unfair for the city to prevent them from using the space as it was intended. In the last two years, the old bar as hosted numerous shows, raves, and theater productions, and members of Klúbburinn are fighting to keep the venue alive. In a statement to Vísir, Diego Manatrizio, event manager for the collective, said: “I think this is a unique place in the art scene. We provide a space for many projects that could probably not find a place anywhere else, projects that are first presented here.” However, not all agree, and the City of Reykjavík also claims that the art group never applied for the necessary permits to hold events. Local residents are also unhappy with the venue, saying that the shows last too late into the night and are far too noisy. The art collective, however, has expressed the desire to improve conditions to be able to continue using the space. Birnir Jón Sigurðsson, a member of the collective, stated that they took the complaints seriously and were ready to make changes. However, he said, “If we don’t get help from the city, we’ll have to close the business.”","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

Eiríkur stated that foreign labour is projected to play a larger role in Iceland’s economy in the coming years, and that it is imperative to provide immigrants with more opportunities to learn Icelandic. Specifically, he fears that Iceland’s workforce may split into an Icelandic-speaking overclass with an English-speaking underclass in the service, restaurant, and hotel industries. “I think it’s quite clear that if we want to continue the Icelandic language, then we have to do something,” Eiríkur stated. Additionally, he called for more and better teaching materials and courses to be offered to foreign workers. “It must be possible for people to study Icelandic during working hours and so on,” he said. He has been critical of Icelandic prescriptivists in the past, saying that an image of a pristine Icelandic language that does not change with the times and Iceland’s shifting demographics cannot be continued. Eiríkur has also called for the need for more openness in the Icelandic language community, saying that it is too easy for foreigners to revert to English, and not integrate themselves into life in Iceland.

Logi was inspired to start dancing ballet after seeing a production of Billy Elliott at the Reykjavík City Theatre when he was eight years old.

Of Time and Water captured the judges’ attention for its ability to make the enormity of the climate crisis seem both tangible and tackleable. In their nomination, they write: “While the devastations of our climate crisis are measurable, statistics have failed to adequately motivate change. An acclaimed writer and environmental activist makes its scale and scope tangible by sharing tales of his grandparents, Icelandic citizen scientists whose honeymoon was spent surveying the Vatnajokull glacier, when “glaciers were a symbol of something great and eternal, like oceans, mountains, and clouds.” Now Vatnajokull is dying. Weaving together family history, folklore, and glaciology, the book attempts a ‘mythology of the present’ that might inspire the action required to deflect the most horrific Anthropocene destruction.

604,Iceland Review,“Iceland’s Settlers Were Not Vikings”,2022/08/29,"“Vikings were never anything more than gangs, just like the criminal gangs of today,” stated Ethnologist Árni Björnsson in a recent TV interview for Stöð 2. Árni criticised the National Museum of Iceland, his former workplace, for hosting “Viking battles” as part of Reykjavík Culture Night earlier this month, saying Iceland’s historical ties to Vikings are limited at best – and that Vikings are nothing worth glorifying. “For over 100 years, it has been trendy in the European and North American entertainment industries to refer to everyone who lived in the Nordic countries in the High Middle Ages as Vikings. That is of course far from the truth. Residents of the Nordic countries were of course first and foremost farmers and fishermen,” Árni explained. Vikings are, however, mentioned more often in sources, “just like international news today is more likely to mention terrorist acts.” Both the National Museum and the Settlement Exhibition hosted Viking-themed events for Reykjavík Culture Night. Árni explains that the idea that Icelanders are the descendants of Vikings is largely the product of 19th-century foreign authors, who romanticised this idea in their work: the idea has no historical basis. “Violence has always held a certain charm. People enjoy reading crime novels, and they enjoy making up Viking stories. But I think that a public institution that wants to be taken seriously shouldn’t take part in that. I find that unacceptable, because what is Iceland’s connection to Vikings? Iceland’s settlers were not Vikings. Vikings didn’t come to Iceland, except a few elderly, exhausted ones.” One of Iceland’s most respected ethnologists, Árni was the Director of the National Museum’s Ethnology Department between 1969 and 2002.

Placed under house arrest, co-founder Maria (Masha) Alyokhina disguised herself as a food courier and fled both her home and the country in May of this year. Having had her passport confiscated and been placed on Russia’s “Wanted” list, Alyokhina initially had trouble crossing the Russian border, but Deutsche Welle reports that with the help of Icelandic performance artist Ragnar Kjartansson, she was “able to obtain European documents, allowing her to enter Lithuania.” Ragnar has been an effusive supporter of the group and their work. “Pussy Riot’s performances are, without a doubt, some of the most important political art works of the 21st century,” he said. “If ever there were artists who gave everything for their art, it’s these badasses.

The project deals with our common past, present and future,” Sweden’s Ambassador to Iceland Pär Ahlberger told Iceland Review. “I am very grateful to the Government of Iceland and our more than 30 Icelandic partners for the very generous support to this, the most comprehensive Swedish – Icelandic project ever.” Daniel Solander (1733-1782) was a Swedish naturalist who studied under celebrated professor of botany Carl Linnaeus. He travelled as far as Australia and New Zealand for scientific expeditions, where he helped make and describe collections of plants from various regions. Solander visited Iceland in 1772. A travelogue from the expedition, Letters on Iceland, first published in 1777, is available in full on the Icelandic National Library website. One of the cornerstones of the commemorative project is the art exhibition Solander 250: Bréf frá Íslandi (e. Solander 250: Letters from Iceland), which features the work of ten Icelandic artists who contribute with their perspectives of Daniel Solander’s expedition to Iceland. The exhibition opens in Hafnarborg gallery in the town of Hafnarfjörður on August 27, but will travel to nine other locations in Iceland over the coming 18 months. The exhibition Paradise Lost – Daniel Solander’s Legacy, first exhibited in New Zealand and Australia in 2019-2021 and focusing on the first encounter between Sweden and the Pacific Region, will be shown across Iceland alongside Bréf frá Íslandi. Other events that will be part of the commemorative project include musical performances and educational events.","Culture,Nature,Society",0,1,1,0,1,0
608,Iceland Review,MATEY Seafood Fest Serves Up the Best of the Westman Islands,2022/08/21,"A new festival seeks to celebrate the produce and producers of Iceland’s Westman Islands. The MATEY Seafood Festival is a collaborative project between the island’s restaurateurs and food producers and will take place from September 8-10. Restaurants, fish factories, food producers and other food industry service partners collaborate to highlight the food of the islands. With the MATEY festival, islanders hope to spotlight “one of the best culinary destinations in Iceland,” and give guests a taste of “a variety of stunning dishes” that are made solely with ingredients sourced in and around the Westmans. Leading chefs from neighbouring Nordic nations will also take part in the festival, offering their own twists on “authentic local dishes.” Restaurants Gott, Slippurinn, Einsi Kaldi, and Næs will host menus from guest chefs Chris Golding, Leif Sørensen, Ron McKinlay, and Fjölla Sheholli and Junaid Juman, respectively, serving up local ingredients. In addition to serving up local cuisine in Heimaey’s restaurants, the festival will also feature events in which businesses in seafood industry open their doors, give some insight into their operations, and discuss the “blue economy” that is so vital to the Westmans’ way of life.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
609,Iceland Review,Björk Announces New Album: Fossora,2022/08/20,"Björk has announced that she will be releasing a new album, her tenth, this fall. The revelation comes via a wide-ranging interview in The Guardian. The album will be called Fossora, “the feminine version of the Latin word for digger,” and anchored by the two “lodestones” of bass clarinet and gabber, a style of Dutch techno that came out of The Netherlands in the 90s. Interviewer Chal Ravens describes Fossora as a reaction to 2017’s Utopia and says the album features “moments of astonishing virtuosity and bewildering complexity, and, like much of her recent music, a resistance to easy melody.” The new album is, in a way, a product of the COVID and the space and time that lockdown gave Björk to explore and develop new songs and sounds. But it’s also reflective of “a transitional time,” in the singer’s life, says Ravens, with songs that in one instance, honour the passing of her mother and in another, serve as a kind of farewell to her youngest child, Ísadóra, who recently moved out of her home. (Both Ísadóra and Björk’s son Sindri provide backing vocals on that track, called “Her Mother’s House.”) There will be a fantastical quality to Fossora, Björk explained, but also an earthiness. “Let’s see what it’s like when you walk into this fantasy and, you know, have a lunch and fart and do normal things, like meet your friends,” she said to Ravens, while also describing Fossora in an email to the Indonesian duo of Gabber Modus Operandi as her “mushroom album.” “It’s like digging a hole in the ground,” she wrote to the pair. “This time, I’m living with moles and really grounding myself.” Fossora will be out on One Little Independent Records this fall.

610,Iceland Review,No Deadline for Decision on Whether Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson Will Be Prosecuted in UK,2023/02/05,"The Office of the Crown Prosecutor in the UK is currently reviewing evidence against Icelandic footballer Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson and deciding whether it will pursue prosecution against the former Everton midfielder or drop the matter entirely, RÚV reports. Gylfi Þór has been accused of “multiple sexual offenses” and has been subject to a travel ban that has prevented him from leaving the UK since being arrested at his home in Manchester in July 2021. Responding to an inquiry from RÚV, Nazia Dewji, a spokesperson for the Office of the Crown Prosecutor, said that there was no set deadline by which a decision on the matter must be made. Dewji said that the evidence from the police investigation had been received by the prosecutor at the end of January. Gylfi Þór was released on bail shortly after his arrest, but has not played in a professional football match since then. He was taken off the active roster for the Premier League team Everton and his contract was not renewed when it ran out last summer. He has not played with the Icelandic Men’s National Team since then either. In October 2022, Gylfi Þór’s father Sigurður Aðalsteinsson, gave an interview in which he called on the Icelandic government to come to his son’s assistance. The case had been dragged on for far longer than legally reasonable, he argued. “If someone is detained in some [other] country for some hypothetical offense, you can’t just let him languish there for a year, year and a half just endlessly waiting,” he said. At the time, the footballer’s family hoped to change Gylfi Þór’s legal domicile to Iceland so as to make it harder for the British judiciary to extend his travel ban. It was the first time that anyone close to Gylfi Þór had confirmed that any such travel ban existed.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
611,Iceland Review,Deep North Episode 10: First Among Equals,2023/01/27,"Every weekday morning at the public pool in West Reykjavík (Vesturbæjarlaug), Halldór Bergmann – called Dóri – slips into his grey, square leg suit and declares that he shall swim 1,800 metres (1.1 miles). He is 68 years old, and, also, a great mangler of the truth. He swims only 200 metres (660 feet), on a good day, but does not like the facts getting in the way of a good time – and this may be his best quality: his penchant for childlike embellishment. It’s this trait, above any else, perhaps, that has won over a troop of loyal followers, and why those followers have, in the spirit of his own whimsy, taken to calling him “the Commander.” In the latest episode of Deep North, we consider Icelandic swimming pool culture and ask: is the public swimming pool a wellspring of social democracy?","Podcast,Sport",0,0,0,0,0,1
612,Iceland Review,Iceland Leaves 2023 Handball Championship with a Victory,2023/01/23,"The Iceland Men’s National Handball team went out in style yesterday with a 41-37 victory over Brazil. Unfortunately, Iceland will not be moving past Group II, where it won a place after its initial seeding into Group D. Iceland will be leaving this world championship with a total of three victories and two losses, and a total goal difference of +11.  Brazil led the way in the first half of the final match, with the score standing at 22-18 at halftime. However, the Icelanders managed to make up the difference in the final 10 minutes of the game, with Bjarki Már, Janus Daði, and Kristján Örn leading in goals. In an interview with RÚV, Icelandic Men’s Nation coach Guðmundur Guðmundsson said: “We took a good long look at how we were doing and had to really zero in on the goal and make a comeback with that old Icelandic pride.

613,Iceland Review,Icelandic Handball Fans Banned from Using Drums,2023/01/19,"Supports of the Icelandic team at the 2023 World Men’s Handball Championship in Sweden have been banned from using drums in the Gautaborg stadium, Morgunblaðið reports. In a statement to Morgunblaðið, Gauti Sigurgeirsson, a member of the Icelandic national team fan club, said: “The Swedish handball association won’t let us have drums in the stands at the stadium […] But we’re sticking to our plan. We’re going to the stadium and doing everything we can to support the Icelandic national team, with or without our drums. It just doesn’t make sense that all of a sudden we’re not allowed to have any instruments.” Icelandic fans have so far been happy with the accommodations at the 2023 World Men’s Handball Championship. The championship is being hosted in nine cities throughout both Poland and Sweden. Matches hosted in the Swedish city of Kristianstad, such as the opening match between Iceland and Portugal, allowed fans to support their team with instruments.  Now, fans of the national team are disappointed but determined to continue rooting for “our boys,” as they are affectionately known. While instruments are not allowed in the general stands, however, a special balcony is reserved in the Gautaborg stadium, where the Icelandic fans can drum to their hearts’ content. Gauti continued to say to Morgunblaðið: “It was just great in Kristianstad. It’s a great town. We got to do everything we wanted and it went really went, but everything changed in Gautaborg. We weren’t allowed to bring any of our instruments when we played Sweden, which definitely has an effect on the support. But we just used our hands and voices instead.”    ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

During her time at the prestigious French football club, she became the first Icelander to score in the finals of a Champions League match, among other achievements. After becoming pregnant in 2021, however, she ran up against cultural expectations within professional sports that discourage athletes from having children during the height of their careers.  Sara Björk arranged with her club to return to Iceland for the duration of her pregnancy, with the understanding that she would return to the team after giving birth. However, Lyon soon began withholding her pay. When it became clear the withheld pay was part of a pattern, Sara Björk pressed claims against Lyon.

Ómar Ingi led his team Magdeburg to a German Championship in 2022 and also played a key role for the Icelandic national team at this year’s European Handball Championships. Each year, the Association of Icelandic Sports Journalists presents its Athlete of the Year award. Yesterday, the honorary title was bestowed upon handballer Ómar Ingi Magnússon for the second year running. Ómar Ingi was the top scorer at this year’s 2022 European Men’s Handball Championship, which took place between January 13 and January 30.

This year, he led the team to their first Handball-Bundesliga (HBL) title in 21 years. During the campaign, Ómar Ingi became the second-highest scoring player in the German league and was voted the league’s best player by a wide margin. This fall, Ómar Ingi also helped Magdeburg win the IHF Men’s Super Globe. Magdeburg currently sits in fourth place in the German league.

The team faces Portugal in the second round of the qualifying play-offs tonight in Paços de Ferreira, Portugal It was heartbreak in Utrecht on September 6; aware that a draw would suffice for its first-ever ticket to the World Cup, the women’s national football team fought hard to keep the score line at 0-0 after regulation time had elapsed – despite the patent superiority of the Dutch. During the 91st minute, Dutch forward Esmee Brugts delivered a bullet pass into Iceland’s box, which sailed past her teammate Stefanie van der Gragt and Icelandic defender Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir – before winding in the far corner of Iceland’s goal. It was a painful defeat – but all hope wasn’t lost. The women’s national team will face off against Portugal in the second and final World-Cup qualifying round at the Estadio Capital do Movel in Paços de Ferreira, Portugal at 5 PM tonight. A win will secure a historic ticket to the 2023 FIFA World Cup. Speaking to Vísir, midfield Dagný Brynjarsdóttir stated that this would be the team’s third “big match” of the year. “We played against France and the Netherlands and neither of those games went our way. But hopefully, this third game will be different.” Dagný hopes that she and her teammates will harness the feeling of losing against France and the Netherlands. “That’s a feeling that we don’t want to experience again. It’s up to us to do everything in our power to transform that feeling into something better and more fun.” Iceland is currently ranked 14th according to FIFA; Portugal is ranked 27th.

Former team captain Aron Einar Gunnarsson has been handed the armband again, having not been selected to the team since 2021, RÚV reports, following accusations of sexual misconduct. At a press conference at KSÍ (Football Association of Iceland) headquarters today, Arnar Þór Viðarsson, head coach of the men’s national football team, announced the squad for the team’s upcoming fixtures. The team will play a friendly against Venezuela on September 22 before facing off against Albania five days later, in what will be an important match in the Nation’s League. Notable inclusions in the squad include former captain Aron Einar Gunnarsson, who returns to the team after accusations of sexual assault surfaced in the summer of 2021. The police opened an investigation into the matter September of that year, and when he was left out of the squad a month later, Aron Einar released a public statement accusing KSÍ’s board of directors of yielding to “cancel culture.” As reported by RÚV, coach Arnar Þór subsequently called for KSÍ and ÍSÍ (the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland) to set clear rules for which players could be selected to the team. New rules were later established, RÚV notes, which stipulate that players cannot be selected for the national team if they are under police investigation. Aron Einar Gunnarsson is currently eligible for selection as his case was dropped in May. Forward Alfreð Finnbogason, who plays with Lyngby in Denmark, also returns to the team after a near two-year hiatus, following prolonged injury, as do defender Guðlaugur Victor Pálsson and goalkeeper Elías Rafn Ólafsson. Perhaps the most notable exclusion from the team is Albert Guðmundsson; during the press conference, coach Arnar Þór expressed disappointment with Albert’s attitude during the last international break. “To me, it’s a great honour to play for the national team, and that calls for 100% focus, every day, always. You’re either 100% with us or you’re not,” Arnar explained. Brynjar Ingi Bjarnason was also left out of the team; Sverrir Ingi Ingason and Arnór Ingvi Traustason announced that they were unavailable, owing to personal reasons; and Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson is recovering from a minor injury.

The fisherman was taken to Hvolsvöllur for medical care, and has since been transferred to Reykjavík. The man, reported to be in his 60’s, survived the incident with severe burns, but further details regarding his condition are not known at this time. The original police report can be seen below in a public Facebook post from the South Iceland police. The cause of the incident is attributed to longer-than average fishing gear, which is said to have hit a power line. The fisherman is said to be experienced, but was using a style of telescoping pole that can reach 8-10m in length. This style of rod is uncommon in Iceland, but relatively popular in Spain. As of this time, the origin of the fisherman is unclear. Such incidents are nearly-unheard of in Iceland. Nevertheless.

Vísir reports that Jastrzembski endured repeated xenophobic comments and discrimination on the basis of his nationality while living and working in Iceland. The 25-year-old defender opened up about his experience in Iceland in an interview with the Polish paper Gazeta on Thursday. “It’s the worst country I’ve ever been to,” he said. “I will never go back. Many Poles live there and they’re fine, but my experience of Icelanders is terrible. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. People are sorted into categories there.” “The club treated me worse because I have a Polish passport. From day one, those people had no respect for me.” In the interview, Jastrzembski recalled an incident in which he was putting up scaffolding at the stadium in Selfoss. He was doing so from a ladder that an Icelandic woman was holding for him. “Then the boss came and told her to stop helping me because the wind wasn’t that strong, and I’d be fine. The woman left and I fell,” Jastrzembski said, adding that the woman had felt bad about the accident and he’d told her not to worry. The supervisor then began speaking to her in Icelandic and she translated what he said for Jastrzembski. According to the woman, what the Icelandic man said was: “To hell with him. He’s just a Pole. If he dies, there are plenty of Poles who can take his place.” ‘Requested to be released from his contract for personal reasons’ In a Facebook post about Jastrzembski’s departure from the team in July, the team wrote: “Defender Chris Jastrzembski has played his last game for Selfoss.

Chris joined the team in the winter and played 13 games this summer and scored one goal.

Hlíðarfjall and a 3000-m [1.86-mi] elevation gain (earning 3 points with the International Trail Running Association). “This section has been impassable due to snow since the winter,” read a Facebook post about the organizers’ trail-clearing efforts on Tuesday. “But many hands, shovels, ( and chainsaws!) made for light work and [this stretch] shouldn’t be much of an obstacle this weekend.” Súlur Vertical director Þorbergur Ingi Jónsson later clarified that the chainsaws were used to break through hard-packed ice along the trail and said the whole process took only a few hours. “When you have such a powerful group, projects like this one are no problem.” “This also opens one of the most popular mountain trails around Akureyri to the general public and we welcome that,” he wrote in Tuesday’s post, “as one of the goals of the Súlur Vertical organization is to promote outdoor activity and physical activity in the area.” The weather forecast isn’t looking promising for the coming weekend, and there’s even the possibility of snow in the mountains. But Þorbergur isn’t discouraged. “We’ll just make the best of the conditions and we’ve got plenty of hot cocoa and things like that.” Learn more about Súlur Vertical (in English) here.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
625,Iceland Review,Open Water Swimmer Takes to the Sea for a Good Cause,2022/07/23,"Open water swimmer Sigurgeir Svanbergsson took to the sea on Friday for a good cause. RÚV reports that the self-trained sea swimming enthusiast set out on his odyssey from the Westman Islands to Landeyjasandur on the mainland at 3:45 pm and was expected to complete the 12-km [7.5 mi] journey in five to six hours, arriving between 9:00 and 10:00 pm. Sigurgeir is swimming on behalf of Save the Children Iceland. (Donate here.) All the money he collects for his monumental undertaking will be donated. He considers this a truly pressing issue, noting that one in every six children in the world—or 450 million total—live in conflict zones, which is a 5% increase from last year. ‘I always have to go a little further and try something a little harder’ This isn’t Sigurgeir’s first open water plunge—nor his first for charity—although he is still relatively new to the pursuit. Last year, with very little prior swimming experience, he swam across Kollafjörður from Kjalarnes to Reykjavík. (In that instance, he swam for Unique Children in Iceland, a support group for children with rare diseases.) Sea swimming was a pursuit he took up during the COVID lockdown years, unable to practice or compete in his first sport, Lethwei, a particularly strenuous, full-contact form of boxing practiced in Myanmar. “I was supposed to be competing in the world championship, but COVID spoiled that. […] So I had to find something else to do.” Sigurgeir had no particular background in swimming and had only really practiced when he was in school. But that was part of the appeal for him. “I’m really interested in putting myself in situations that are really challenging. It’s so interesting to see where your head goes when you find yourself in a situation that’s actually kind of impossible.” And he learned a lot during the course of that first journey, even if it wasn’t all smooth swimming. “It went well, I finished it, but with all kinds of complications,” he recalled in a recent radio interview. For one thing, the engine went out on his escort boat and Sigurgeir ended up having to swim around it for an hour and a half while he waited for a new one. During that break, the currents in the fjord changed direction and so Sigurgeir had to complete his journey swimming against a strong current. The swim took nine hours. “It was hard and I almost failed,” he said. “But then I always have to go a little further and try something a little harder.”  Learning from experience Sigurgeir has certainly found something “a little harder” with his current swim. The distance of the Kollafjörður swim was just the same, 12 km, but the swim from the Westman Islands will be much more difficult. “So, this is the open sea, of course,” Sigurgeir noted. “I really have no idea what I’m getting into, in a way.” He’s learned from previous experience, however, and in addition to training extensively in advance of Friday’s swim—both physical preparation in the form of cold training and mental preparation for better stress management—Sigurgeir has made some adjustments. He said he’d be more mindful of the change currents and planned to bring a kayak with him where he could eat mid-swim. He was also going to practice better feeding methods. Sigurgeir said he didn’t do this very well last year and as a result, ended up vomiting for the last three hours of his swim. “There was actually a trail of vomit behind me the whole way.” Outlook good At time of writing, Sigurgeir hadn’t completed his swim from the Westmans to Iceland’s mainland, but the conditions were good when he set out. The currents were favourable, and the weather on Heimey, the only inhabited island in the Westmans from where he set out, was good: 10°C [50°F], with just a slight breeze, a bit of fog, and scattered showers. Sigurgeir was in high spirits before setting out on Friday afternoon, saying: “In the first place, I just think it’s exciting. Just such an exciting idea to give this a try. And then there’s a good cause, too.” Check Sigurgeir’s Facebook page, Synt frá Vestmannaeyjum (‘Swam from the Westman Islands’), to see how his saga ended on Friday night.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
626,Iceland Review,Unbeaten Iceland Out of European Championships,2022/07/19,"Iceland is out of the 2022 UEFA European Women’s Football Championship after a tie game against France. Iceland landed in third place in their group after all three of their matches – against Belgium, Italy, and France – ended in 1-1 ties. Team captain Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir told RÚV she is proud of the team’s efforts, though the result is disappointing. Iceland’s women’s team gave their all during last night’s match against France. Though they did not win, the tie result was nevertheless impressive, as the French team had won their last 17 matches, and only lost one of their last 33 games. “We showed character and gave the French a proper match today,” Sara Björk stated in an interview after the game. “We were playing against one of the best national teams in the world and we have a damn good chance. It was a great game. Our best one in the championship. Unbelievably proud of the team and the group.” The result, though disappointing, can still be seen as an improvement from the last UEFA Championship, in 2017, when Iceland lost all of its matches.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
627,Iceland Review,Record Numbers of Pink Salmon Caught,2022/07/15,"Iceland’s Marine Research Institute has issued a report on salmon and trout catches in 2021. 339 pink salmon were reported, an all-time record. Pink salmon, also called humpback salmon for the prominent bump males develop during their spawn migration, is native to the Pacific ocean and is considered an invasive species in Iceland. Some 323 pink salmon were caught by anglers, and 16 were caught in nets. In total, 36,461 salmon catches were registered last year, with 53.7% of them released and 46.3% of them landed. The total catch is recorded as 46,832kg. In the second half of the 20th century, the fish was stocked in Russian streams. After this introduction, the pink salmon has made its way around the arctic region to the North Atlantic, and the species has been recorded not just in Iceland, but also throughout the UK and Ireland as an invasive species. Environmentalists are concerned that the fish may disrupt native habits and compete with other species for food.","Nature,Sport",0,0,1,0,0,1
628,Iceland Review,Family Requests Body of Mountaineer John Snorri Be Buried with Companions,2022/07/13,"In a recent public announcement on Facebook, Lína Móey, wife of the Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson, expressed her wishes for the burial of her husband. John Snorri was a respected mountaineer and the first Icelander to summit several major peaks, including Lhotse and K2. He and his climbing companions Ali Sadpara and Juan Pablo Mohr went missing in February of last year and were officially presumed dead. Their bodies were found in July on the slopes above Camp 4. In her statement, Lína Móey clarified that the death of John Snorri had “turned their world upside down.” She and her family needed some time to come to a decision that would be both be good for them, but also consider the safety of those offering to help them. As there are currently several teams attempting a K2 summit, it is unclear which team will come across John Snorri’s remains first. Lína Móey stated that her first choice is that John Snorri’s body be moved to his climbing companions and given a suitable burial. If this is not possible, then she desires him to be moved off the trail and placed out of sight. In her statement, she also requested that no photographs or videos be taken of his body without permission. Lína Móey will be travelling to Pakistan at the end of July and staying there for some two weeks to finalize her affairs. In her statement, she thanked all who had helped her family so far and expressed both her gratitude and concern for the safety of all.

629,Iceland Review,Icelandic National Women’s Team Starts EM with Draw,2022/07/11,"The Icelandic Women’s national team drew a tie in their opening match against Belgium last night, with both teams scoring one point. The Icelanders kept up the pressure on the Belgian goal for some time, and the Icelandic goal came shortly into the second half of the match, with a header by Berglind Björg. However, the Belgians soon equalized the score with a penalty shot on the Icelandic goal. Some 2,000 Icelandic fans were in attendance to show support for the team, including the Prime Minister. In honour of the famous Tólfan fan club, the popular Viking Clap was performed at the twelve-minute mark. Notably, the girls played the match in their old kit. Although the new uniforms for the team are ready, the Icelanders were obliged to wear white as the away team. France currently leads Group D, with Iceland and Belgium tied for second and third, and Italy in fourth place.

630,Iceland Review,Sailing Competitors Seek Safe Harbour in East Iceland,2022/06/18,"Twenty-three of the competitors in France’s Vendée Artique sailing competition are seeking shelter in Fákrúðsfjörður Bay in East Iceland due to dangerous weather conditions on the Atlantic Ocean, RÚV reports. This is the first time that skippers participating in the race were supposed to have crossed the Arctic Circle north of Iceland, but given the current weather conditions on the course, race organizers have elected to end the race in Fákrúðsfjörður. Three of the skippers had already arrived in Fáskrúðsfjörður as of Friday night, with the rest expected in the early hours of Saturday morning. Roughly a third of the sailboats were known to have been damaged in the difficult weather on the way to Iceland, where the East Iceland Sailing Club was preparing to receive them. Route designed to be difficult The newly-extended 3,500-nautical-mile Vendée Artique begins and ends in Les Sables d’Olonne in France and circumnavigates Iceland. It is the first qualifying race for the Vendée Globe, a single-handed, non-stop, round-the-world yacht race. As it is intended to help participating skippers test their boats and get a feel for the Vendée Globe, the course was designed to be difficult, with purposefully difficult weather conditions. Sailing from north to south “is a particular technical exercise,” explains the competition website, “requiring numerous manoeuvres and sail changes […] when rounding Iceland.”   In its explanation for why the race was suspended, the organizers wrote that “a low pressure system is threatening the fleet. The skippers are likely to face tough conditions and the back of the fleet already have more than 40kts at times and gusts to 60kts.” Given the fact that the race “is quite isolated,” there was also the additional risk that rescue would be complicated in the event it was necessary. The next Vendée Globe will take place in 2024; in order to be entered in the race, skippers must take place in at least two of five qualifying races. The next qualifying race is the Route du Rhum in November, which sales from Saint Malo, in Brittany, France, to Pointe-á-Pitre, Guadelopue.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
631,Iceland Review,Six Icelandic Women Complete Relay Swim Across English Channel,2022/06/08,"Sea swimming group Bárurnar (the Waves) reached the coast of France yesterday after completing their relay swim across the English Channel. The trip took the six women 16 hours and four minutes in total, and its last part was against the clock and in choppy waters, as the weather was turning. Bárurnar consists of Guðmunda Elíasdóttir, Elsa Valsdóttir, Sigríður Lárusdóttir, Harpa leifsdóttir, Jórunn Atladóttir, and Bjarnþóra Egilsdóttir. “We are just regular women, mothers and grandmothers,” Guðmunda told Iceland Review. “We’re no athletes or elite swimmers, just a group of middle-aged women.” While the idea to swim across the English Channel was first sparked some years ago, the group only started regular training last autumn. “Some of us had a solid background in swimming,” Guðmunda noted. “While others were just starting to learn the front crawl stroke in August of last year!” Being regular women with regular lives, the group has its ups and downs, and last year, during preparations for the swim, one of its members got an ostomy bag. She did not let it interrupt her practices and became the first ostomate to cross the Channel. The group also includes two surgeons. With their relay swim, they want to raise awareness for the condition, inviting those who followed their travails to support the Icelandic Ostomy Association. The shortest distance between the coasts of the UK and France is 34 km, but their route was a little longer as they had to swim with the heavy Channel currents amid high waves. The women swam 54 km in total, taking turns swimming for an hour at a time. The group had its doubts about whether they would set off for their swim yesterday morning due to the bad weather forecast and their accompanying boat captain’s pessimism. Still, as it was the only feasible day in the seven-day window they had planned, they set off anyway. The six swimmers took turns swimming for one hour at a time while the other five tried to keep warm in the boat. The temperature of the water was about 13.5°c.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
632,Iceland Review,New National Sporting Arena to be Built in Laugardalur,2022/05/08,"The Icelandic government and City of Reykjavík have agreed to build a new, national sporting arena in Laugardalur. The arena will fulfill the requirements for international competition in indoor sports and greatly improve the available facilities for schools and sports associations in Laugardalur. Construction is expected to be completed by 2025. This was announced in a joint press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Education and Children, and the City of Reykjavík. The state and the City of Reykjavík have agreed to guarantee funding for the arena’s initial costs in their long-term budgets. A full cost estimate will be available after the final design and a feasibility study are both completed. The division of the total project cost will depend on the utilization of the arena and the needs of each party—the state with an eye to the requirements for international competitions that national sports teams compete in, and the city with an eye to the needs of local sports clubs and sports education. A special committee will be established to oversee the feasibility study and construction preparations, not least how the financing will be handled. The Icelandic government and City of Reykjavík will hold a joint competition to determine the arena’s design and overall appearance. Preparations for a national stadium for track-and-field in Laugardalur and a national football stadium will continue. A market survey will be carried out to lay out clear options for how to proceed with the development of the national football stadium.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
633,Iceland Review,Women’s Euro Stadium Choices ‘Disrespectful to Women’s Football’,2022/04/23,"Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir, the captain of Iceland’s national women’s football team, had strong words this week for the stadiums that have been chosen for the women’s European Championship, which will take place in England this summer, ESPN reports. The choice of several low-capacity arenas are “embarrassing,” Sara Björk remarked, and “not the respect we deserve. They haven’t prepared for the fact that we can sell more than 4,000, it is disrespectful to women’s football.” Sara Björk made the remarks while speaking to the podcast Their Pitch and was particularly referring to the 5,000-seat Manchester City Academy stadium, where two of Iceland’s games will be played. “I am disappointed with the arenas we have been given,” she said. “It is shocking—we play a tournament in England with several large arenas, and we get to play at a training facility that takes around 5,000 spectators.” A Euro 2022 spokesperson responded to Sara Björk’s critiques saying, “Manchester City Academy is not a training ground. It is the official home stadium of Manchester City Women’s Football Club…We believe that with two of the biggest football stadiums in England [Old Trafford and Wembley], four venues with a capacity of 30,000 or more, two venues over 10,000 and two stadiums under 10,000, the right mix of stadiums has been chosen to provide the tournament with a platform to fulfil its potential.” FA’s stadium choices ‘felt hugely unambitious then and looks almost ludicrously low-key now,’ says Guardian football writer In a piece for The Guardian, however, football writer Suzanne Wrack called Sara Björk’s frustrations “understandable,” saying “her remarks highlighted a number of important questions, chiefly among them whether the Football Association was ambitious enough in its choice of venues and whether it has done enough to adapt to the accelerating growth of the game? Arguably, the answer to both questions is no.” Wrack goes on to point out that while women’s football, and the public’s interest in it, was in a much different place four years ago when England’s Football Association (FA) made its bid to host the tournament, “the signs of potentially rapid growth were already there and were either overlooked, ignored or woefully underestimated.” She continued by saying that “[i]t was, and always has been, clear that major international competitions qualitatively impact the growth of the women’s game.” Preceded then as it was by the launching of the Women’s Super League as a full-time professional league in 2018, the 2019 World Cup, and a broader, stated goal of doubling the fanbase by 2020, the FA’s choice of stadiums “felt hugely unambitious then and looks almost ludicrously low-key now.” ‘They should 100% reconsider’ Responding to the FA’s claim that they’ve chosen “the right mix of stadiums…to provide the tournament with a platform to fulfil its potential,” Sara Björk noted that both of Iceland’s matches at the academy have already sold out, and she believes that these sales, as well as sell-outs across the group phases, speak for themselves. “But matches will be played in larger arenas that I’m sure will sell out,” she continued. “Women’s football explodes, and you start to get the respect you deserve. It’s getting better—more money is being pumped in now and it’s going in the right direction. But there are still things that need to improve.” “They should 100% reconsider [changing the stadiums],” Sara Björk concluded. “Because if you look at the reactions and how many people buy tickets and how popular it has become, then you have to reconsider.” The Women’s Euro 2022 will be held from July 6 – 31; Iceland will play July 10 (vs. Belgium); July 14 (vs Italy); and July 18 (vs France).

Vísir reports that Olympian was just released from isolation after having been diagnosed with COVID last Saturday. This means that Sturla Snær can begin training again but will not be able to actually compete unless he receives a negative PCR test result prior to his events, one of which is this weekend. See Also: Five Icelanders Compete in 2022 Winter Olympics Sturla, who competed in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, was one of Iceland’s flagbearers during the opening ceremonies last Friday, along with cross-country skier Kristrún Guðnadóttir. Following the ceremony, he began to experience COVID symptoms and was taken to a hospital in Beijing and put in isolation. After a few days, Sturla began to feel better, but he also began to get bored. “There was no coffee or anything like that,” he remarked in an interview. “It wasn’t possible to go on any social media that we use at home. […] There wasn’t even a table and chair to sit at. You had to eat in bed and lie there all day. Not much in the way of entertainment, so I had to make my own.” To while away the time, therefore, Sturla decided to create a website for the road-marking company he runs with his father. As of Friday, Sturla was still in quarantine and still testing positive for COVID.

Six Icelandic players tested positive for COVID-19 the night before the game, the first match of the European Handball Championship’s main round.  Rough news following a smooth start Following a positive start to the European Handball Championship, which saw the Icelandic men’s national handball team win all three of its matches in the preliminary round, the squad suffered a four-point defeat to Denmark last night. The match was the first game of the tournament’s main round.   On the evening before the game, news broke that three Icelandic players had tested positive for COVID-19: goalkeeper Björgvin Páll Gústavsson, centre-back Elvar Örn Jónsson, and left back Ólafur Andrés Guðmundsson. More bad news broke on the following morning when it was revealed that captain Aron Pálmarson and winger Bjarki Már Elísson had also tested positive. The final blow arrived just a few hours before the game against Denmark; centre-back Gísli Þorgeir Kristjánsson also tested positive.  The players have little to no symptoms, according to reports. Critical of tournament organisers In an interview with Vísir yesterday, Bjarki Már Elísson criticised the tournament organisers for not doing enough to minimise the risk of infection:   “We’ve been doing everything in our power to avoid infection; we’ve been holed up in our hotels since January 2,” who added that the team had been prepared for the worst after the first three players tested positive.” “The conditions at the hotel are such that there are tourists and other guests staying alongside us, which, personally, I find absurd. But, of course, there are fans in the stadiums, and we’re doing interviews, so you’re always at some risk. Perhaps it was to be expected,” Bjarki continued.  “I suppose what’s most disappointing, however, is that tournament organisers didn’t provide better conditions. Ensure that we were more isolated, that there aren’t other people staying at the hotels; all of the teams are eating in the same places, too. This allows infection to spread, and it was expected, but it is also extremely disappointing.” A tough schedule ahead Iceland will play its second match of the main round tomorrow, Saturday, January 22. The team will face off against France, the reigning Olympic Champions, with Iceland’s President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson expected to be in the stands.

641,Iceland Review,New Report: Football Association Urged to “Shoulder Responsibility”,2021/11/05,"A workgroup established by the Icelandic Football Association (KSÍ) has submitted proposals on how the association could better handle allegations of violence and sexual assault. The report, which tackles issues of “procedure, attitude, and culture,” encourages the association to shoulder increased responsibility. Following resignations by Director Guðni Bergsson and the board of directors earlier this year, the Icelandic Football Association established a workgroup to examine procedures relating to allegations of violence and sexual assault. The group’s mandate was to review responses to sexual and violent assaults within Icelandic football “in collaboration with outside professionals.” A few days ago, the workgroup submitted its report, which was subsequently published on the association’s website. On the first page of the report, the authors urge the leadership to assert their opposition to all kinds of violence publicly: “This summary report contains the workgroup’s proposals alongside an encouragement to the leadership to make good use of the present opportunity to take a clear stance against violence of any kind – especially sexual violence – and, thereby, improve the culture and attitude of individuals connected to the association.” The report is predicated on four proposals. First, the workgroup advises that the association update its code of ethics, adding provisions relating to allegations of violence and creating channels for individuals to report misconduct and bring charges. The Icelandic Football Association is encouraged to sign contracts with members of national teams in which the code of conduct is explicitly referenced. Furthermore, the report advises that these contracts include provisions regarding violent misconduct, wherein – among other conditions – athletes commit to declaring any charges of violent or sexual misconduct. Finally, the authors counsel that employees who occupy positions of confidentiality within the association be made to confirm the code of ethics with their signatures. Second, the workgroup stresses the need to create clear channels and response protocols for instances of violence within the Football Association and its member societies. The Director of the Football Association is to be designated as a “special liaison” to communication consultants within sports and youth clubs. Furthermore, instructions on how to report violence are to be made accessible on the association’s website and on all member societies’ websites. Third, the association is encouraged to take a “clear stance” against violence and to coordinate the messaging of its member societies. The workgroup also advises that leadership attend seminars on equality and violence each year following the annual meeting. Fourth, the workgroup advises that the association assume a leading role in equality within sports in Iceland, that it adopt an “equality plan,” and that it work to ensure gender balance within all of its internal committees and councils. The report concludes with further encouragement in which the association is urged to welcome its responsibility while at the same time taking it seriously: “The association cannot, by itself, change society; however, it does occupy a unique position in terms of effecting significant and positive change. The association’s messaging and policies matter. By acting on these four proposals, and by leaning on the insights of professionals in the field of equality and violence, the association can become a role model and demonstrate that it is intent on shouldering responsibility.”",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
642,Iceland Review,Out of National Horse-Riding Team Due to Sexual Assault Conviction,2021/11/02,"Veteran jockey Jóhann Rúnar Skúlason has been removed from Iceland’s national equestrian team due to a sexual assault conviction. Mannlíf reports that in 1994, Jóhann Rúnar was convicted for raping a 13-year-old girl the previous year, when he was 24 years old. The jockey was also recently convicted for domestic violence in Denmark, his country of residence. Guðni Halldórsson, chairman of the Icelandic Horse Association (Landssamband hestamannafélaga, or LH) told Vísir it was a difficult decision to remove Iceland’s “biggest competitor and biggest name” in the sport from the national team, but added that “sexual offences, especially involving children, cannot and will not be tolerated on our watch.” Guðni stated that he first heard of the conviction when Mannlíf reported on it late last month and that he is not aware of any other sexual assault cases coming up within the association previously. Sexual violence within sport has been a big topic in Icelandic media lately after several cases of sexual violence emerged connected to the national men’s football team. The Football Association was accused of silencing victims of violence and sexual assault in cases involving team members. “It’s a different discussion and a different way of dealing with issues today than it was five years ago,” Guðni stated in reference to the cases involving football players. “This decision was made based on the environment and the situation today and we stand by it.” In 2019, Jóhann Rúnar was a triple world champion in horse riding and was also nominated for Iceland’s Athlete of the Year award.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
643,Iceland Review,Record-Breaking Weightlifter Works Day Job as Flight Attendant,2021/10/31,"Anna Guðrún Halldórsdóttir set three European records and two world records in her weight class at the European Masters Weightlifting Championships in the Netherlands earlier this month, Vísir reports. If that isn’t impressive enough, the 52-year-old resident of Hveragerði, South Iceland managed to achieve these results while still holding down a job as part of Icelandair’s cabin crew. She even worked a six-hour flight to Chicago the day after the competition. “It was awesome,” Anna said. “I got first place in my weight class and set world records and European records and I’m just so happy about all of it, just over the moon. It’s been a bit hard to practice alongside work, but it works.”  Anna Guðrún trains at least five times a week at her local CrossFit. She took up weightlifting at the gym shortly after moving to Hveragerði and it was quickly apparent that she had real potential. “We saw right away that she’s really strong,” said Anna’s trainer, María Rún Þorsteinsdóttir. “She’s a former handball champion. We knew for sure that she had a chance at these world records […].” Anna Guðrún hasn’t let her world champion status go to her head, though, and doesn’t have plans to stop working as a flight attendant any time soon—her weightlifting skills come in handy all the time. “It’s great,” she laughed. “I can help everyone with their hand luggage and other things, so that’s something.”  ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
644,Iceland Review,Glíma: Icelandic Wrestling Applies for UNESCO Status,2021/10/26,"Icelandic wrestling, known as glíma, could soon be on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage, RÚV reports. The sport involves wrestlers gripping their opponent by the waist and attempting to throw them to the ground. Glíma was brought to Iceland by Norwegian settlers. Though originally opponents held onto each other’s trousers, in 1905 a special belt or harness was introduced to the sport, allowing wrestlers to have a better grip on each other. The sport is known for emphasising technique over force and was featured in a demonstration at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Guðmundur Stefán Gunnarsson teaches glíma in Njarðvík, Southwest Iceland. He is working to get the sport onto UNESCO’s official list of intangible cultural heritage. It recently reached the first milestone in that process, which is to be registered as Icelandic cultural heritage. According to Guðmundur Stefán, the atmosphere of glíma is very positive and competitions are characterised by respect among athletes. Heiðrún Fjóla Pálsdóttir, an award-winning glíma competitor who teaches alongside Guðmundur, agrees. “There’s such incredibly good morale in Icelandic glíma. Everyone is friends and it’s always so much fun.” More information about glíma is available in English on the website Lifandi hefðir (Living Traditions).","Culture,Sport",0,1,0,0,0,1
645,Iceland Review,Six National Team Players Accused of Violence and Sexual Assault,2021/10/13,"Six members of Iceland’s men’s national football team have been accused of sexual assault. The board of the Football Association of Iceland received a confidential email from activist group Öfgar naming six members of the team and dates of their alleged violent and sexual offences, according to mbl.is sources. The national team coach was also accused of belittling the alleged victims in the wording of his statements to media. Aron Einar Gunnarsson, Kolbeinn Sigþórsson, and Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson have all been named in Icelandic media in relation to violent or sexual offences. The other three players remain unnamed. The players will not play on the national team while the cases are being investigated.

646,Iceland Review,Aron Einar Not Selected to the National Team Despite Availability,2021/10/01,"Aron Einar Gunnarsson, captain of the men’s national football team, has not been selected to the squad for upcoming games against Armenia and Liechtenstein for the World Cup qualifiers. While the team’s head coach Arnar Þór Viðarsson stated that he was not asked to exclude any players, and board members have denied any interference, Aron Einar maintains that the exclusion stems from the incoming board of directors yielding to “cancel culture.” The footballer contends that he was not selected to the squad because of rumours of sexual misconduct that he allegedly perpetrated in 2010. According to RÚV’s sources, police are reinvestigating the 2010 incident at the victim’s request. Yesterday, Arnar Þór Viðarsson, head coach of the men’s national football team, announced a squad of 25 footballers for the upcoming matches against Armenia and Liechtenstein for the World Cup Qualifiers. Among the names missing from the squad was Aron Einar Gunnarsson, captain of the team for the past decade and who was presumed to be fit. Before the team’s press conference yesterday, rumours spread that the Football Association’s board of directors had prohibited Arnar Þór Viðarsson from selecting Aron Einar to the squad on account of the latter being implicated, without being named, in an incident of sexual violence occurring eleven years ago. According to mbl.is, who reached out for a statement, outgoing and incoming board members denied these allegations. Arnar Þór Viðarsson has also stated that he was not asked to exclude any players. After the squad was officially announced, Aron Einar Gunnarsson released a statement to the Icelandic media accusing the Football Association’s incoming board of directors of excluding him from the team. In the statement, Aron Einar explains that he had informed the Association that he was available, in shape, and had fully recovered from an illness. Furthermore, he had notified the Association that he was innocent of all accusations, referring to an incident of alleged sexual violence that occurred in Copenhagen in 2010. Given that the team has performed poorly over the past weeks, Aron Einar says that he was forced to surmise that his exclusion was not tactical but that the Association had decided to submit to the demands of cancel culture. Aron Einar concluded his statement asking the police to allow him to give a formal statement regarding the incident in 2010. Mbl.is reported yesterday evening that the police authorities had decided to reopen the case; according to RÚV, charges had been brought against Aron Einar in 2010, but those charges were subsequently dropped.   Here is Aron Einar’s statement in full: “As reported today, I was not among those players selected by coach Arnar Þór Viðarsson for the national team’s upcoming games. This exclusion follows my announcement to the Football Association that I was available, in shape, and fully convalesced following an illness. Furthermore, I had informed them that I had done nothing wrong, in reference to the alleged culture of violence within the Football Association, which has been widely discussed recently. During the press conference, however, the reasons behind said squad selection were hardly discussed. I can only draw the conclusion that the incoming board of directors, whose election was not contested, had, without a mandate, exerted itself to cancel me, as reported on DV.is; the team’s recent results hardly suggest that sidelining the team’s most experiences players would be wise, which cannot be the reason for my exclusion. I have also not asked Arnar Þór to remain quiet about the reasons for his not selecting me. For me, my family, and those friends who know me, it is deeply hurtful that the National Football Association, for whom I have given my all, for the past 97 national games, has decided to yield to demands founded on vague rumours about members of the national team. It puts one into an indefensible position. On social media, an event that occurred in Copenhagen in 2010 has been widely discussed. I have not had the opportunity to discuss that event formally with the Football Association, have not been allowed to defend myself against these misdeameanours (sic), which is why I am hurt by this unceremonious dismissal. Furthermore, the police has never contacted me in relation to any investigation. I have never been notified that I was suspected of a crime and neither have I at any point been called into interrogation. As a captain, I have long since learned to shoulder responsibility; cancel culture has recently been tolerated, but it should not be. And so while I reject all violence I declare that I have not been violated any person or woman. I refuse to play a codependent role toward the street justice, regarding an incident that supposedly occurred eleven years ago. If anyone has any criticism to level in my direction, I ask that same person not to show me any mercy, to accuse me by name, and give me the opportunity to defend myself. That’s honest.  In light of all of this, I have decided to ask the police to allow me to give a formal statement about that night eleven years ago.” Aron Einar Gunnarsson","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1
647,Iceland Review,Uncontested Election for Football Association’s New Chair,2021/09/27,"Vanda Sigurgeirsdóttir, a former member of the women’s national football team, is the only candidate in the running for the position of Chair of the Icelandic Football Association’s interim Board of Directors. As the deadline for candidacies expired last Saturday, Vanda is set to be appointed without election. On August 30 – following criticism for its handling of revelations of sexual violence by members of the Icelandic football league – the Icelandic Football Association’s Board of Directors resigned. The resignation came just a few days after the Association’s Director, Guðni Bergsson, stepped aside. (Guðni stated in an interview with RÚV in August that the Association “had no knowledge” of accusations of sexual violence that were circulating online.) In a press release announcing its resignation, the Board of Directors also stated that it would be holding an extraordinary meeting in four weeks’ time to elect an interim board. Given that aspirants were required to announce their candidacy no later than a week before the extraordinary meeting (to be held next Saturday, October 2), it is apparent that Vanda Sigurgeirsdóttir will be chosen without election. Vanda Sigurgeirsdóttir (full name Halldóra Vanda Sigurgeirsdóttir) is a former multi-sport athlete who played both for the women’s national football team and the national basketball team. In 2001, Vanda became the first woman in Iceland to coach a men’s football team (Neisti from Hofsós). Besides Vanda, eight individuals have announced their candidacy for the eight available positions on the Association’s interim Board of Directors. Likewise, three individuals have announced their candidacy to the three available positions on the Football Association’s auxiliary board. As reported by Fréttablaðið, given the few candidacies, there will be little ado as far as elections are concerned. The interim Board of Directors will be in office until the Association’s next annual meeting, which will be held in February of next year.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
648,Iceland Review,Iceland Loses 4-0 to Germany in World Cup Qualifer,2021/09/09,"The Iceland men’s national football team lost its world cup qualifier match in Reykjavík against Germany on Wednesday night, Vísir reports. This is Iceland’s fourth loss in six qualifying matches thus far. The team has lost five home matches in a row. Germany took the lead in the fourth minute of the first half, with a goal by Serges Gnabry. Mark Antonios Rüdiger scored a second goal for Germany in the 23rd minute. Germany got its third goal after halftime, courtesy of Leroy Sané, and Timo Werner pounded the final nail in the coffin about a minute before the match ended. Iceland remains, therefore, in the fifth seat with four points in the J-group, which includes Armenia, Germany, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, and Romania. Iceland has four remaining qualifying matches: two home matches in October and two away matches in November. Changes in starting lineup, Hannes retires
 Head coach Arnar Þór Viðarsson and Assistant Coach Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen made six changes to the starting lineup ahead of Wednesday’s match. Hannes Þór Halldórsson started as goalie in place of Rúnar Alex Rúnarsson, who began the last two games. Jón Guðni Fjóluson and Ari Freyr Skúlason started as defenders in place of Kári Árnason and Guðmundur Þórarinsson. Guðlaugur Victor Pálsson was substituted in midfield for Andri Fannar Baldursson. Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson came in on the right wing and Þórir Jóhann Helgason on the left. After the match, Hannes Þór Halldórsson announced that it was his last as part of the Icelandic National Men’s Football team. All together, Hannes played in 77 matches for Iceland—more matches than any other goalie in the history of Icelandic football. “I’ve played for the Men’s National Team for ten years now, almost to the day,” he said in an interview after the match. “I’m really proud of that and have had some incredible moments in this jersey—many of my best memories. But we’ve come to a generational changeover and we have so many great goalies, so I think this is the right time for me to step aside now and let them take the reins without me breathing down their necks. So this was my last game on the national team tonight—thank you all.” Hannes might be leaving football, but that doesn’t mean he’s resting on his laurels. In 2021, he made his debut as a film director, with Cop Secret, which received positive advance reviews. Hannes directed and co-wrote (with Nína Pedersen and Sverrir Þór Sverrisson) the “raucously entertaining” spoof on the cop film genre.

Meanwhile, a joint statement from The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland, Íslenskur Toppfótbolti, and the Icelandic Football Association asked that Icelandic football be given room to follow through on the work they’re preparing to combat the issues raised in the past few weeks.

The workgroup will cooperate with the communications advisor of sports and youth issues. According to the statement, the reviewed work procedures will be implemented into all associated institutions of the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland, making the association as a whole more prepared to handle such issues professionally.

649,Iceland Review,Icelandic Football Requests Space To Enact Improvements,2021/09/02,"As preparation continues for the Icelandic national men’s football team’s three upcoming qualifying matches for the World cup, the Icelandic Football Association’s CEO Klara Bjartmarz is on temporary leave in addition to resignations from the association’s director and the entire board. The association has been accused of sweeping allegations of violence and sexual assault perpetrated by members of the national team under the rug but now requests space to follow through on an action plan against sexual assault and violence.

One of the Association’s deputy directors told Vísir that if the entire board resigned, FIFA might consider the Association incapacitated and take over under emergency protocols. That has occurred twice before, in Bosnia during times of war, and in Greece during the economic crisis. A joint statement from The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland, Íslenskur Toppfótbolti, and the Icelandic Football Association asked that Icelandic football be given room to follow through on the work they’re preparing to combat the issues raised in the past few weeks. The plan includes electing a new temporary board and organising a workgroup that will work on creating and reviewing the necessary work procedures to ensure the right reactions to reports of sensitive matters.

They note that while Icelandic football’s reputation has been damaged, it also has the strength, ability, opportunity and powerful members to improve and meet the challenges together. The workgroup on sexual assault and violence within Icelandic football led by Kolbrún Hrund Sigurgeirsdóttir intends to work hard and professionally. Kolbrún stated to Fréttablaðið that the group will inspect the culture down to the youngest players. Hanna Björg Vilhjálmsdóttir who wrote an article challenging the Association to deal with allegations of violence has been offered a position in the group, as well as Steinunn Gyðu- og Guðjónsdóttir, Stígamót representative. Other members are yet to be announced but Kolbrún has said that the group will likely include a lawyer as well as someone from the Association. Kolbrún added that she had received several phone calls from staff and managers of football clubs over rumours of players within their ranks who might have committed violence. The staff don’t have confirmation that the rumours are true and they don’t know how to react in such a situation. “It’s a tough job and this won’t be accomplished in one day. It’s clear that we need to cover everything down to the youngest kids in football to change certain attitudes and to create a better atmosphere of safety and equality,” Kolbrún stated. She told Vísir that their role is to “figure out how we can make sure that there’s followthrough on such reports, and ensure that such cases won’t be let slide or solved in secrecy. We need to make sure that all reports receive a reaction. Icelandic football has a prime opportunity to change the toxic masculinity that has been allowed to fester, stated football fan and Iceland’s Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdótti, according to Vísir. “I think Icelandic football has the opportunity to handle this in a new way and make some radical changes. It’s important and I say this as the mother of a junior football player, not just as prime minister,” she stated. Þorsteinn V. Einarsson hosts a podcast on masculinity and played football in the past. He has pointed out that the issue is so deep-rooted that footballers might not know how to react. “I really think that footballers don’t know what to say, how to react or what they can do. The fear of losing social standing, respect and power in the locker room breeds a certain kind of powerlessness,” he told Vísir “being a feminist isn’t the most popular thing to do in football, or to interfere with equality issues or taking a stand on uncomfortable subjects.” Þorsteinn added that players might fear repercussions from “old-school” coaches or teammates when returning to practice after speaking out on sensitive topics. “to state the obvious, not all football players are jackasses. But they can all take responsibility for the change that’s necessary.” Tólfan, the national teams’ fan support group has issued a statement condemning all violence. They declare their support for victims of violence and will be showing it symbolically during the upcoming matches, staying silent until minute 12 of every match. The group also encourages its members to wear hats and insignia supporting women against violence such as the UN Women fuck violence campaign. Their statement notes that their key phrase has always been “don’t be a jackass,” and that violence is jackassery in its every form. Kolbeinn Sigþórsson is one of the players removed from the national team following the past weeks’ events. He plays for Sweden’s IFK Göteborg. While he wasn’t named by the victim who came forward following KSÍ’s original denial of reports of violence, Kolbeinn has stated the matter. While admitting that he “behaved less than perfectly,” and apologising for his behaviour, he denied harassing or assaulting them.  “I repented and took responsibility and was ready to make amends. They had requests for an apology and payments which I agreed to. Additionally, I donated 3 million ISK to Stígamót [a centre for survivors of sexual violence] and in that way supported their important fight against sexual violence,” Kolbeinn stated. “The Icelandic Football Association was informed of the settlement process but their public denial of violence led to Þórhildur Gyða feeling robbed of that settlement. I have an understanding of that. I regret my behaviour at that time and am fiercely against the violence of any kind. I am still systematically working on my issues.” Þórhildur was surprised by his statement, stating that she had not named him as she didn’t want to pull focus from what she believes is the main issue, the culture within the football association. She told Vísir that following her interview, she has been contacted by others telling her stories of sexual assault or violence by six or seven former or current members of the men’s national team. Kolbeinn’s Swedish team has issued a statement condemning his behaviour but recently stated that they will not be terminating his contract, Vísir reports. Kolbeinn joined Göteborg’s team from AIK, whose manager now states that the Icelandic Football Association kept information from them when signing Kolbeinn. Henrik Juerlius told Aftonbladet that they contacted the Icelandic national team and Kolbeinn’s former clubs to find out if there was anything in his past that they needed to know about but received no such information. Kolbeinn signed with AIK in March 2019, two years after the Icelandic Football Association was notified of the incident. At a press briefing for the upcoming national team match against Romania, veteran team member Kári Árnason states that it’s tough to enter a project by the national team under the current circumstances. “it’s a sensitive issue and what can I say? I can’t really touch the subject without throwing someone in front of a train, whoever it is, and I think it’s best that I don’t.” Iceland is playing Romania tonight in Laugardalsvöllur, followed by matches against North Macedonia, and Germany. The team’s coach Arnar Þór Viðarsson has stated that it’s hard to prepare for a match under the circumstances but they’re doing their very best to stay focused on the game. Kári added that the upcoming project is tough and feels for young players entering the group under these circumstances. “It’s different this time and the focus outwards hasn’t really been on the football but that’s everything we’re focusing on. I don’t envy them entering into these discussions. It’s so sensitive that it’s hard to focus on something else but we’ll try to keep their minds on the project at hand. It’s not the most fun position to be in to enter the national team when people aren’t talking about young and exciting players but something totally different. They’ll just have to show what they got on the field and hopefully, they’ll start talking about them,” Kári stated. The Iceland-Romania match tonight is sold out but tickets for the Iceland-North Macedonia match on Sunday are still available.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
650,Iceland Review,Icelandic Football Association Board Resigns As More Allegations of Sexual Assault Come To Light,2021/08/31,"The Icelandic Football Association had knowledge of more allegations of sexual offences than the one reported over the weekend, RÚV reports. They received reports of an alleged gang rape this summer and another incident was brought to their attention over the weekend. In addition to the Association’s director, the entire board has now resigned but the Association’s CEO told RÚV she did not intend to resign despite pressure to do so. Read more: Icelandic Football Association shaken by accounts of sexual assault Reports of sexual assaults by members of Icelandic football, including members of the men’s national team shook Iceland over the past weekend. Following marathon meetings and coming under fire in the media, Director Guðni Bergsson resigned. The Association’s board did not intend to resign at first, with one of the Association’s Deputy Directors Borghildur Sigurðardóttir stating that the entire board resigning would render the Association incapacitated. The result was unsatisfactory according to Íslenskur Toppfótbolti, an organised interest group of Iceland’s top football leagues, including both men’s and women’s teams. An Íslenskur toppfótbolti board member stated to Vísir that “by and large, people don’t think enough is being done and are unsatisfied with the Icelandic Football Association over the weekend. People think more needs to be done. The leadership is stripped of trust and […] Guðni alone can’t carry that cross.” The board of Íslenskur Toppfótbolti later issued a statement demanding that Klara Bjartmarz, the Icelandic Football Association’s CEO and the entire board resign. The statement also included demands that an extraordinary annual meeting be held to elect a temporary board, as per the Association’s laws, to regain trust within the football leagues and the public. The statement notes: “The Association’s CEO and part of the board have held office for a long time and in light of their position they are responsible for the issues that have been discussed for the past few days. Football in Iceland can’t accept that the current board of the Icelandic Football Association and the Association’s CEO will lead the effort to fix things that have been broken and to scrutinise the current culture from the ground up.” Following Íslenskur Toppfótbolti’s statement, nine football clubs issued demands that the Icelandic Football Association calls an annual meeting immediately to elect a new board. The clubs are Einherji, ÍR, Magni, Leiknir F. Hamar, Völsungur, Víðir, Njarðvík, and KV. Their statement reads that the reputation of Icelandic football has been greatly damaged, making it necessary to call an annual meeting and shape reactions that for the future will earn the trust of all of the Associated clubs as well as the community as a whole. Longtime KSÍ sponsors such as Coca-cola Iceland, Landsbankinn Bank, and Icelandair have also been in touch with the association requesting more information. A press release from Icelandic Football Association stated that their representatives will be in touch with all major sponsors to respond to “loud demands from major sponsors that real change will be effected within the Icelandic football and the association.” They added that they appreciate the “clear message” they have received that believable steps towards change must be taken. The board had another meeting yesterday, which lasted into the night. Following that meeting, it was announced that the entire board would be resigning and calling for an extraordinary meeting of the Association in four weeks. Invites with information on the date, schedule and organisation of the meeting will be sent out to associated clubs within the next few days, the notice states. It is also noted that the board would like to express that a workgroup’s efforts to reexamine reactions to sexual offences and violence within the association, and how victims have been supported and will be supported moving forward, will remain a priority. This is in tune with challenges from Íslenskur toppfótbolti and the wishes of Associated Clubs, as well as societal pressure to call for an extraordinary meeting. The board will also meet with UEFA and FIFA representatives to reassure them that no interference with the Icelandic Football Association will be necessary. While the Board and Director of the Icelandic Football Association have now resigned, the Association’s CEO Klara Bjartmarz has no intentions of resigning. In yesterday’s 10 o’clock news, Klara told RÚV: “I am an employee of the football association and have been working here for 27 years, which is a long time. I’m ready to keep going and will work with a new board when that time comes.” Íslenskur Toppfótbolti has also called for Klara’s resignation in order to regain the public and the football leagues’ trust in the Association. As the Director has resigned, the power to lay Klara off as an employee of the Association lies with the board but according to one of the acting directors of the association Gísli Gíslason, they do not intend to use it. He stated to Vísir that: “It’s important that the CEO’s work will be handled fairly.” When asked if Þórhildur’s case was the only one reported to the Association, Klara revealed that the Icelandic Football Association also had knowledge of an incident of group rape. She stated that she had heard of the case this summer and that it was currently “in process” within the Association. She added that another incident of the sexual offence had been reported to a board member this weekend. She does not know if the new incident also involves a member of the national team. “I didn’t ask about specifics but I know that a board member was notified, passed it along immediately, and started the process. Sexual offences are a sensitive subject and shouldn’t be passed around. We should make sure that they are treated but we shouldn’t discuss them if it’s not needed.” Vísir reports that it’s likely that the group rape in question concerns a woman around thirty who stated on Instagram this May that two Icelandic men had raped her in another country in 2010. They were well known then and one is quite famous today. They have both been members of the national team and one of them is one of the biggest stars of the men’s national team. *content warning* In her post, the woman states: “I had drunk some alcohol but I suspect something was put in my drink, could have been anything. To make a long story short, I threw up over one of them in the taxi on the way to their hotel, and again in the hotel bed, but they didn’t let that stop them and took turns raping me where I lay in the bed naked from the waist down with vomit in my hair, face, and clothes,” the post read. The woman was around 20 when the incident occurred. She added that not a day passes in the eleven years that have passed that she wasn’t reminded of it. She intended to press charges, hired a lawyer and was deposed with the police. Everywhere, she was told that the case would be difficult to pursue as it had happened in another country and there were two against one. She was asked over and over again if she wanted to go through that. “After months of waiting, I decided not to pursue it any further, I wasn’t strong enough, I couldn’t go through more emotionally.” She posted her story under her own name and reposted it this weekend, tagging the Icelandic Football Association. Footballer Garðar Gunnlaugsson weighed in on Twitter yesterday, saying that it would take more than new leadership to fix the toxic football culture. He asks boys in football to take part in the fight to create a healthier environment within football where misogyny and racism is a thing of the past. “well boys,” Garðar wrote. “The least part of the problem has been laid off, the board of the Icelandic Football Association. That’s not where the problem lies, the problem is largely rooted in this toxic culture we’ve grown up in as athletes, be it amateurs or professional players. We have the opportunity to change the culture and make sure young footballers grow up in a healthier environment where misogyny and minority prejudice is a thing of the past. It’s not an overnight change, it will take time but let’s make it start with us!

651,Iceland Review,Icelandic Football Shaken By Accounts of Sexual Assault,2021/08/30,"Director of the Football Association of Iceland Guðni Bergsson is resigning following criticism on the Association’s behaviour concerning revelations on sexual violence by members of the Icelandic football league, including national team players. The Association’s board has issued an apology but does not intend to resign. Two members of the national football team have been taken out of the line-up in three upcoming qualifying matches for the World Cup. On August 13, Hanna Björg Vilhjálmsdóttir penned an article calling for an end to the silence surrounding sexual assaults and domestic violence committed by Icelandic football players, citing stories revealed on social media in response to a different high-profile sexual assault case. The Icelandic football association was pressed to respond, finally stating that they dealt with all incidents of violence through appropriate channels and denying accusation of silencing. Guðni Bergsson stated in an interview with RÚV that but they couldn’t react unless they were officially notified and that they had received no such notifications. In an interview with RÚV last Friday, Þórhildur Gyða Arnarsdóttir revealed that in 2017, she was sexually and physically assaulted by a member of the national football team. She and another woman who was assaulted that same night reported the incidents to the police. Months later, her father was going to attend a national team match when he realised that the man who had assaulted his daughter was in the line-up. He contacted the Director of the Icelandic Football Association, Guðni Bergsson, and notified him of the incident. Guðni contacted both of Þórhildur’s parents and stated that this was a serious matter and there would be consequences. He then removed the player from the national team for a time. When contacting the Football association director, Þórhildur’s father also contacted the President of Iceland, who replied to his letter, stating that he had discussed the matter with Guðni himself, but on account of his office, he could not become directly involved in the matter. Þórhildur noted that Guðni should have thus been well aware that a member of the national football team had been accused of violence. Following this communication, Þórhildur states she was contacted by the Football Association’s lawyers, who offered her financial compensation in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. Þórhildur turned down the offer and was then contacted by another lawyer on behalf of the football player who had assaulted her. The player confessed to his actions and paid her damages. Þórhildur states that she has no grievances with the football player but she wasn’t expecting him to be chosen for the national team when the Football Association knew of his violent actions. Guðni Bergsson later admitted that it was a mistake to state that no reports of violence had reached the ears of the football association, claiming that he misremembered the incident, believing it to have been only a physical assault, not a sexual assault. The Football Association issued a statement that the lawyers offering the non-disclosure agreement had not been working for them directly but Þórhildur disputed that statement. The first lawyer who contacted her had introduced himself as the football player’s lawyer but following that conversation, she contacted a legal representative who did some research and then told her that the lawyer was working for KSÍ. Later, when another lawyer working for the football player contacted her, the matter was resolved. The interview caused an uproar on social media, especially as the case comes on the heels of another high-profile sexual assault case which shook the nation. In that case, popular media personality and podcaster Sölvi Tryggvason was accused of sexual assault. Another recent high-profile case of a football player accused of sexual assault is the case of Everton-player Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson, accused of sexual abuse offended in the UK. Stakeholders within the football industry as well as ministers in Iceland’s government have expressed concern and requested clarification from the football association. The board of the Icelandic Football Association met on Saturday for a meeting that lasted long into the night, but was ultimately inconclusive. Another meeting began at 10:00 AM on Sunday, and the two women in the boardmet with a representative from Stígamót women’s shelter, as well as Hanna Björg Vilhjálmsdóttir, who recently penned an article condemning the football association for silencing discussion on reports of sexual violence on behalf of national team members. At 4:00 PM, Football Association staff were called into a meeting. Just before 5:00 PM, the Football Association of Iceland issued a short notice on Twitter, stating that Guðni Bergsson was resigning as Director of the Football Association and more information would be released shortly. Later that day, the Football Association issued a formal apology, translated in full below. Two players who were slated to play with the national team for the three World Cup qualifying matches have been pulled from the line-up: Kolbeinn Sigþórsson and Rúnar Már Sigurjónsson. They will be replaced by Viðar Örn Kjartansson and Gísli Eyjólfsson. The Icelandic Football Association’s website stated that Kolbeinn will not be participating on grounds of the decision made by the Association board whereas Rúnar Már withdrew due to injuries and personal reasons. According to visir.is, Kolbeinn is the football player who assaulted Þórhildur in 2017. Þórhildur Gyða called this development a good start but said more action was needed, stating: “We can’t blame the protection of perpetrators within the Icelandic Football Association on one guy. A new board is needed, not just a new director.” The Board of the Icelandic Football Association’s Statement in full:  Dear victims. We, the board of the Icelandic Football Association believe you and apologise wholeheartedly. We know that we as the parties responsible have let you down and we intend to do better. The board has met over the past few days concerning the serious allegations that have been brought against the association recently on silencing sexual assault cases. We take the matter very seriously. Right now, we will start to work with outside professionals on reviewing all responses to sexual assault and violence within the association and how we have and will support victims. A group of professionals will be established and the Board of the Icelandic Football Association resolves to deal with these matters fully and completely and follow the advice of the group. Additionally, we would like to ask victims or others who have information on serious violence within the association to come forward. We will welcome you with open arms. We want the cases to be handled appropriately and we want to ensure that the responsibility of the violence will be placed on the shoulders of perpetrators, not victims.  We intend to fix things that have been broken and inspect the culture that exists within the football movement from the ground up in order to make sure everyone working within the industry experiences welfare and safety, while listening to victims and taking their interests into consideration.  On account of the statement the board issued on August 17 in response to accusations of violence on behalf of the men’s national team, it should be noted that the statement was based on the limited information the board had at the time, lacking data and further information that have later come to light. We apologise to Hanna Björg Vilhjálmsdóttir and others who stood at the front lines pointing out the violence within the Icelandic Football Association for the statement which belittled their accusations and assumed no responsibility nor sincerity.  It has already been revealed that the Director of the Football Association has resigned and accepted responsibility for how matters were handled. Until further decisions have been made, the Deputy Director will take over his work. All board members have considered their position. In order to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the association, the board’s conclusion is that it is reasonable that they keep their positions until the association’s next annual meeting in February of next year when board members are voted on.  We want to reiterate that the general staff of the Football Association has performed their duties with care and loyalty and holds no responsibility for the events that are unfolding.  This great wave that has been crashing for the past weeks has touched us all. A part of the largest volunteer movement in Iceland, what KSÍ does and says, matters. We have never been as aware of that as we are now and will seek the help of the community to make radical changes, support victims and be a part of the solution. This project will take time but we will begin right away.  The football movement is part of the community and we as a community all need to do better to support victims and fight sexual violence.

652,Iceland Review,Cycling Race a Rare Opportunity for Riders,2021/07/30,"More than 100 cyclists took part in a socially distanced group ride on Thursday from Siglufjörður to Akureyri in North Iceland, RÚV reports. The event was part of the Akureyri Cycling Festival, which started last Saturday and will end on Sunday. Competitors were organized into different race groups according to distance, the shortest of which, for adults, was 78 km [48 mi] and the longest of which was 102.8 km [639 mi]. The longest route took cyclists through the Héðinsfjörður and Múlagöng tunnels. And although climate conditions aren’t ideal in the tunnels, festival chair Árni F. Sigurðsson admits, being able to cycle through them is a unique opportunity. “It’s humid and cool,” he said, “and Múlagöng tunnel is one-way and very narrow, which makes it a bit of a struggle. But there’s no other opportunity to bike a route like that in a competition.” Árni said that some people withdrew from the race because of the current rise in COVID infections, but assured that organizers were conscientious about safety measures. Riders were split into smaller groups, some of which never had reason to cross paths with one another. The award competition was also split between two locations and top prizes were given out before all competitors finished the race. “We gave [winners the awards] right away so that people wouldn’t gather together and wait.” This is the fifth or sixth time the Akureyri Cycling Festival has been held, said Árni, and he encouraged people to take a look at the remaining schedule of events (here) as all events are open to the public spectators and take place outside over a large area, in compliance with current COVID guidelines.",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
653,Iceland Review,John Snorri and Companions Likely Reached K2 Summit,2021/07/29,"Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson and his two companions likely reached the summit of K2 before perishing in a storm on the way down. The trio set out to summit the mountain, the world’s second-highest after Everest, last winter but lost contact with base camp on February 5, 2021. Search and rescue efforts in the following days were unsuccessful and their bodies were only found on the mountain earlier this week. A tweet from “Team Ali Sadpara,” the Twitter account previously belonging to John Snorri’s climbing companion of the same name, revealed that Ali’s son Sajid and other climbers were transporting the three bodies further down the mountain to where they would hopefully be retrieved by helicopter at a later date. “At the moment, immediate retrieval efforts can harm the bodies as well as pose great risks to people involved,” the Tweet stated. Sajid Sadpara is securing the bodies of fallen climbers to a safe place. At the moment, immediate retrieval efforts can harm the bodies as well as pose great risks to people involved.

In a statement sent to media, his widow Lína Móey wrote: “John’s family wants to thank you for the warmth, support, and care that we have been shown over the past months and we would like to reiterate our sincere thanks to everyone who has taken part in the search for John Snorri, Ali, and J Pablo.”","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1
654,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Marathon Hasn’t Run Out of Hope for 2021 Race,2021/07/28,"Organizers are considering what, if any, options they have for holding the Reykjavík Marathon this year in a way that abides by current COVID control measures, Vísir reports. The marathon was not held last year because of the pandemic. The Reykjavík Marathon is the biggest race of the year in Iceland and is currently set to take place on August 21. About 15,000 people take part every year. However, current gathering restrictions are set at a maximum of 200 people. Current COVID control measures will be in effect until August 13 and there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about what will happen after that. Silja Úlfarsdóttir, information officer for the Reykjavík Sports Association (ÍBR), says that organizers haven’t given up hope of holding the race in some form this year. Staff is currently assessing the situation in consultation with civil defense authorities. “We were pretty optimistic about being able to hold the race this year, but we’re taking a closer look at it. We’re still relatively optimistic, though.” A number of socially distanced running initiatives were launched last year when the marathon was cancelled and gyms had to be closed. One was ‘Run Your Way!’ which encouraged would-be marathoners to run on their own and collect money for charity. Another was ‘Let’s Run Around the World,’ which allowed participants to participate in a virtual relay race around the world. Silja says that there are a lot of ideas on the table, but can’t comment on which direction race organizers are leaning just yet. “The dream, of course, is to be able to hold the marathon, because the [donations collected] are so important for all the charities.” She says that participating runners have been understanding about the uncertainty: “I think people have just gotten pretty used to this and know that people just need a little time to make decisions about these things.” ÍBR will announce its decision about this year’s Reykjavík Marathon in the coming days.","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1

656,Iceland Review,Two Bodies Found on K2: One May Be John Snorri,2021/07/26,"Update July 26, 2:49 PM: A third body has been found on K2 and it is thus exceedingly likely the two unidentified bodies belong to John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Juan Pablo Mohr. The remains of two climbers have been found on K2, ExplorersWeb reports. One of the bodies has been identified as Ali Sadpara, and the other is believed to be his expedition companion, Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson. The two were last heard from on February 5 some 400 metres from the top of the mountain, which is Earth’s second-highest after Mt. Everest. Search and rescue teams were unsuccessful in finding the men. A Sherpa team found the remains of two climbers on the mountain earlier today. One was identified as Pakistani climber Ali Sadpara while the other was face down and covered in ice, making it difficult to identify. The body was dressed in a yellow and black suit: both John Snorri and Chilean Juan Pablo Mohr were wearing those colours when they were last seen heading up the mountain. However, an ExplorersWeb source stated that the Sherpa team believed the body was John Snorri’s. At 8,611m [28,251ft], K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth and is considered a much more challenging climb than Mt. Everest. In 2017, John Snorri became the first Icelander to top the mountain, which is located on the China-Pakistan border. He then set his sights on being the first person ever to ascend the peak during winter but was beaten to that goal by a team of Nepalese mountaineers in January 2021. Last February, John Snorri was making his second attempt to ascend K2 in winter when he and his expedition lost contact with base camp. There has been speculation that John Snorri and Ali did in fact reach the summit of K2 after they lost contact on February 5 and landed in trouble on their way back down the mountain.","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1

660,Iceland Review,League of Legends Tournament Attracts 600 People to Reykjavík,2021/05/07,"One of the world’s largest e-sporting events went underway in Reykjavík yesterday, RÚV reports. An estimated 600 people have traveled to Iceland in connection to the event, which pits competitors against each other in two different tournaments. Strict social restrictions are in effect in the Laugardalshöll sporting arena. Last year, Riot Games—one of the largest video game companies in the world—was forced to cancel its League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational (or MSI for short) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This year, as countries across the world ramped up their vaccination campaigns, Riot Games announced that the tournament would go ahead in May and that it would be held in Reykjavík. In addition to the MSI, Riot Games also announced that a second tournament, the so-called Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) Masters Reykjavik, would be held alongside the first. The VCT is the first live international tournament for the Valorant video game.
 According to event organizers, Iceland was chosen as a venue for the tournament as it “ranked first” with regard to relevant criteria, ranging from the state of the working environment to stability, in its broadest context. In an interview with RÚV yesterday, Nick Troop—director of the tournament—explained that Riot Games had approached Business Iceland (Íslandsstofa) with the idea of hosting a tournament in Iceland: “It was a win-win for everyone. Iceland is a wonderful country that has responded extremely effectively to the pandemic. We are grateful to be here.” This week, Troop and his cohort traveled to Iceland alongside 11 professional teams from all over the world, in addition to personnel comprising approximately 400 people. “We reach many millions of people from all over the world, across forty different media platforms,” Troop stated. Asked how many people would attend the event, Troop estimated that somewhere between 500-600 people, including professional players and personnel, would be in attendance.  Strict social restrictions will be in effect at the tournament. No one is allowed to enter the Laugardalshöll arena without submitting a negative PCR test. “In collaboration with Business Iceland and the Icelandic health authorities, we decided that every traveler, whether or not they were vaccinated, would self isolate for five days,” Troop explained. “Only after this period of isolation, and only after having received a second negative PCR test, would they be allowed to attend the tournament.” Event organizers will also be taking the temperatures of attendees and tracking the interactions between personnel to ensure effective tracking in the event of an infection.  The tournament goes underway as 17 passenger planes are expected to arrive at Keflavík Airport this weekend. The arrivals make for the busiest travel weekend in Iceland this year, with eight passenger planes expected to arrive on Saturday and nine on Sunday. There are currently three quarantine hotels in operation in the Greater Reykjavík Area, capable of receiving approximately 500 guests.  In early April, Iceland’s Court of Appeal confirmed the district court’s ruling that authorities cannot require people to spend their quarantine at quarantine hotels when arriving in the country. The ruling mandated clearer requirements for home quarantine, regarding, for example, housing and rules of conduct. However, those travelers who are unable to stay in a home quarantine that fulfills the requirements will need to stay at a quarantine facility. No fee shall be collected for the stay.","Society,Sport,Travel",0,0,0,0,1,1
661,Iceland Review,Unemployed Icelanders Offered Training and Jobs as eSports Coaches,2021/02/10,"Unemployed Icelanders will be able to access free training in eSports coaching, thanks to a new collaboration between the Social Affairs Ministry and the Icelandic eSports Association. Iceland’s government has invested ISK 10 million ($78,000/€64,000) in developing and implementing the coaching course specifically for locals who are currently between jobs. Participants will receive a six-month work contract upon completion of training. One goal of the project is to create permanent jobs in the growing eSports industry. “I am very excited about this collaboration with the Icelandic eSports Association, where we are hitting two birds with one stone,” stated Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children. “Create exciting opportunities for unemployed individuals and at the same time strengthen eSports infrastructure. There is a lot of strength and growth in eSports in Iceland, but the industry is young and therefore the infrastructure in clubs is often lacking. There has also been a lack of individuals who have experience in training young people, and it is very important that we get individuals with skills and experience into [the eSports industry].” Ólafur Hrafn Steinarsson, chairman of the Icelandic eSports Association, celebrated the initiative. “This project is extremely important for eSports in Iceland and a great recognition of the excellent work that has been done for eSports in recent years.” Esports are a form of organised video game competitions, played both individually and in teams. The industry has been growing globally as well as within Iceland, which boasts over 20 eSports clubs that provide eSport activities and training for over 600 children. “This project enables us to be at the forefront of developments in this field globally,” Ólafur Hrafn stated of the initiative. “There are exciting times ahead in this new field.” Iceland’s government put together a task force last December to write a policy concerning the eSports industry. The group is expected to finish their work at the end of this month.","Politics,Sport",0,0,0,1,0,1

666,Iceland Review,Statue Would Honour Strongman,2020/10/02,"The family of Jón Páll Sigmarsson have petitioned the city of Reykjavík for a space to erect a two-metre [6.6 ft] bronze statue in honour of the Icelandic strongman known for his brash public theatrics and gentle private persona, RÚV reports. If approved, the statue would stand in front of Jakaból gym, where Jón Páll first began his training. Although he died quite young at the age of 33 in 1993, Jón Páll, who was also known as The Viking, remains one of Iceland’s best-known powerlifters. By the time of his death, he had won the World’s Strongest Man competition four times. In a letter addressed to the city’s culture and athletics council, Jón Páll’s family say the strongman is known worldwide as “the father of modern strength trials.” There have been efforts made to erect a statue in Jón Páll’s honour since his death, but thus far, none of them have yielded any results. Now, however, Jón Páll’s son and his mother have collected donations to fund the statue. April will mark what would have been Jón Páll’s 60th birthday, so his family is especially eager to see the memorial through this time. The proposed statue would be two metres tall [6.6 ft] and one metre [3.3 ft] wide in bronze and would be accompanied by a short biography of Jón Páll and his accomplishments.

669,Iceland Review,Women-Led Social Media Campaign for Constitutional Reform Asks #Hvar?,2020/09/11,"A new social media campaign is calling on the government to make good on its commitment to revise the nation’s constitution, a process set in motion almost eight years ago. Fréttablaðið reports that the campaign was initiated by the Women’s Association for a New Constitution, using the hashtags #hvar (#where) and #HvarErNýjaStjórnarskráin (#WhereIsTheNewConstitution). Young women on TikTok and Instagram have been particularly active in the campaign, with some videos receiving upwards of 10,000 views. Iceland attempted to draft the world’s first “crowdsourced constitution” in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, enlisting citizens—not politicians—to revise the constitution to better reflect the values and rights the nation wanted to emphasize moving forward. The process was intended to be democratic, modern (suggestions were solicited on social media, for instance, and a right to the internet was written into the amendments), and also meant to reflect an unprecedented level of transparency. The constitutional proposals were approved by a two-thirds majority of voters in a referendum that was held in October 2012, but, in a dispiriting turn of events, failed to receive the necessary parliamentary approval they needed to move forward that following spring. Eight years later, participants in the #hvar campaign are posting tongue-in-cheek photos of themselves searching for the new constitution. Is it at the bottom of a laundry basket of dirty socks? Perhaps under a pile of fresh veg, under a rug, hidden in a Where’s Wally? book, or at the bottom of Tjörnin pond? At time of writing, the Women’s Association for a New Constitution’s petition demanding that Alþingi pass the constitutional amendments into law had 19,192 signatures. ","Politics,Sport",0,0,0,1,0,1
670,Iceland Review,English Footballers Fined for Breaking Quarantine in Iceland,2020/09/08,"English national football players Mason Greenwood (18) and Phil Foden (20) have been fined ISK 250,000 ($1,780/€1,510) each for breaking quarantine rules while in Iceland for a match with England’s national men’s team last weekend, Vísir reports. The players have both issued apologies for meeting two Icelandic women in their hotel, a violation of the “working quarantine” regulations visiting athletes are required to follow. Foden, who has a girlfriend and one-year-old son, has issued an apology on his Twitter page. In the statement, he admitted to breaching COVID-19 protocols, calling it a “poor decision” that “didn’t meet the standards expected of [him].” Foden apologised to team manager Gareth Southgate, as well as staff, supporters, and his family. pic.twitter.com/2ECUcTYnaK — Phil Foden (@PhilFoden) September 7, 2020  Greenwood’s apology, issued via Manchester United, was more concise. “Having now had the chance to reflect on what’s happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused,” it reads. “It was irresponsible of me to break the COVID-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public.” Greenwood also apologised to Southgate and promised he would learn from the incident. The two women who met with Greenwood and Foden have both expressed regret over the incident, stating they were not aware the players were in quarantine. Lára Clausen (18), one of the young women, posted a series of videos on her Instagram account last night taking responsibility for recording the videos of the players, which she says were leaked from her private Snapchat account. Lára called the meeting a “huge mistake and complete thoughtlessness” on her part. “I honestly had no idea how famous these boys were. I don’t follow football and never have and had no idea what I was putting on the internet.” Lára stated that the players did not tell the women they were in quarantine.  “If we had known better we would have never gone, knowing they were in quarantine.” Nadía Sif Líndal, the other local who met with the players, posted several Instagram stories insisting that she did not know the players were in quarantine and did not record the Snapchat videos or leak them to the media. Both girls have faced harassment on social media due to the incident. Politicians Hanna Katrín Friðriksson and Helga Vala Helgadóttir are among several public figures that have denounced the vitriol. “Raise your hand if you’ve never done anything stupid,” Helga Vala wrote in a Facebook post about the incident. “Shouldn’t we give them a bit of a break?” ","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1

672,Iceland Review,Tesla Best-Selling Private Car in Iceland Last Year,2023/01/07,"Tesla electric cars were the best-selling passenger vehicle for individual consumers in 2022, RÚV reports. This is part of a larger pattern: more than half of new cars sold to individuals in 2022 were electric cars. Tesla did not, however, sell the most cars overall in Iceland. That distinction belongs to Toyota, although cars sold to rental companies accounted for 73% of its sales last year. Changing patterns and incentives related to energy consumption have significantly shifted the automobile market in Iceland. According to María Jóna Magnúsdóttir, executive director of the Automotive Industry Association, last year was the seventh highest year for automobile sales in the country since 1972. “It’s gone pretty well, in spite of great disasters around the world; car sales here have been good,” she remarked. “We’re naturally seeing a huge spike in the sale of electric cars, especially to individuals. They’re choosing electric cars just over 50% of the time.” Toyota sold the most cars overall, Tesla the most cars for personal use Just under 16,700 cars were newly registered in Iceland last year. Of these, 7,600 were rental cars. Toyota is the foremost seller of cars that will be used on the rental market in Iceland. A total of 2,754 Toyota passenger cars were sold last year, the majority of which—or 1,440 cars—were intended as rentals. The remaining 739 Toyotas were sold to individuals. The manufacturer that sold the second highest number of new cars in Iceland last year was Kia, with 1,800 cars sold. Hyundai was next, with just over 1,400 cars sold. Tesla came in fourth overall, with 1,300 cars sold. However, if only car sales to individuals are considered, then the rankings shift in Tesla’s favor. Tesla sold 872 cars to individuals last year, followed by Toyota with 739, Kia with 717, and Hyundai with 502 cars sold for personal use. Tesla only sells electric cars, but it is not the only manufacturer that does. Toyota, however, has fewer electric options than its fellow brands. Overall, nearly 5,600 electric cars were sold in Iceland last year. More diesel cars were sold in 2022 than in 2021 and 2020. At-home charging only ISK 3 / km Electric cars are commonly considered to be much cheaper to run and maintain in Iceland, not least because electricity is so much less expensive than petrol. It’s been estimated that a five-person electric car costs roughly ISK 3/km [$0.021; €0.020/km] if it is charged at home. The price of domestic electricity in Iceland, including distribution charges, is estimated to cost roughly ISK 17 [$0.12; €0.11] per kilowatt-hour. It is more expensive to pay for electricity at fast charging stations and at so-called supercharger stations, though the charging process is, of course, much faster.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
673,Iceland Review,Central Bank Working on Domestic Payment System,2023/01/05,"The Central Bank of Iceland is working to develop a domestic payment system for Iceland. As more and more transactions become electronic, interest has grown in an independent payment system for Icelandic commerce. Cyberattacks or other disruptions to service in the several foreign payment systems on which so many Icelandic businesses currently rely could cause serious disruption to economic life in Iceland. By working towards a secure and independent solution, the Central Bank of Iceland hopes to make the Icelandic economy more resilient to risk in the future. The Central Bank of Iceland has begun taking initial steps at the request of Iceland’s National Security Council, in line with steps taken recently by other European nations. The Central Bank plans to publish a report on the matter in the coming months, in which possible ways forward will be considered. The Central Bank’s recent report on financial cybersecurity indicated the real possibility of long-term disruption to the payment system following a cyberattack on a foreign payment system. According to the Central Bank, other means of payment need to be provided to ensure that necessities can still be purchased in the event of such an attack. In addition to a domestic payment system, the Central Bank has also called for the creation of preparedness plans in the event of such a disruption. The need for a secure, domestic payment system is especially pressing in Iceland, where fewer and fewer transactions take place with cash. In the past two years, the use of cash in purchases has declined by some 25%, although it is still used by some 40% of the population, especially for gifts and personal payments. In the event of an electronic payment disruption, the Central Bank has stated, there are still enough cash reserves to address such an event.      ",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

The fate of the Reykjanes silicon plant has been up in the air since the 2018 bankruptcy of former owner United Silicon, with many local residents concerned about the environmental impact of the facility. In wake of the talks ending, Arion Bank has cancelled the utility contract with Landsvirkjun, most likely meaning that the plant is now slated to be repurposed or possibly relocated. Since the bankruptcy, extensive renovations to the plant were planned, with increased sustainability a major priority. There has been some interest in investors acquiring the plant, and Arion Bank has looked for potential buyers with experience in the industry. Since the beginning of this year, Arion Bank has been in talks with PCC, an international silicon manufacturer with a facility in Bakki, near Húsavík in North Iceland. The PCC facility is also notable for its use of green technologies and has existed alongside the Húsavík community without problems. PCC is said to have presented ambitious renovation plans for the Helguvík plant, but despite this, talks have fallen through, and Arion is now looking to sell and repurpose the facility. Benedikt Gíslason, director of Arion Bank, stated to Vísir: “The story of the Helguvík silicon plant is well-known. We consider it our duty to make the best use of the infrastructure and everything that has been invested into it.

676,Iceland Review,"Latest from Central Bank: Interest Rates to Increase 0.25%, Now Resting at 6%",2022/11/23,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland has announced today that key interest rates will be raised an additional 0.25%, with short-term interest rates (seven day term deposits), now sitting at 6%. The increase in interest rate comes in response to October inflation, which rose slightly to 9.4% from September’s level of 9.3%. Previous raises to the interest rate were introduced in order to cool the market and fight inflation, but have not had the entire effect hoped for. Interest rates in Iceland now rest at: With the Central Bank’s aim of stabilising prices, it has noted that price increases continue to be widespread, but that they hope to reduce inflation to 4.5% by the end of 2023. In the Central Bank report, it is stated that the Icelandic króna has seen a depreciation since October, and that inflation rates in the bond market have also risen since last month. With the new measures in place, the Central Bank reports an improved economic outlook for 2023, with an expected 2.8% growth in GDP, up from its previous estimate of 1.9%.  This growth is accounted for by higher levels of domestic demand than previously forecast. The Central Bank has also stressed the importance of developments in the labour market in bringing inflation back to acceptable levels, a reference to the previously postponed and now upcoming wage negotiations between many of Iceland’s largest trade unions and SA, the Confederation of Icelandic Employers.  ",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
677,Iceland Review,Iceland Ranked World’s 20th Most Innovative Nation,2022/10/25,"Iceland ranks 20th among the world’s most innovative nations according to the new global innovation index. Switzerland, the US, and Sweden remain top. The Global Innovation Index is “an annual ranking of countries by their capacity for, and success in, innovation.” The index – started in 2007 by INSEAD and World Business – is published by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and is based on both subjective and objective data derived from several sources, including the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum. Falling three places from 2021, Iceland ranks 20th according to this year’s index (the confidence interval indicates that Iceland ranks somewhere between 15th and 20th) and 12th among European countries. Read More: Idea Island (Iceland Is Investing in Innovation) As noted by the government’s website, Iceland’s standing may be somewhat skewed by its size and abundance of natural resources: “As a small country, by international standards, Iceland draws the short straw when it comes to several criteria employed by WIPO during the index’s calculus; the criteria is not patterned to small nations rich in natural resources.” To this point, Iceland scores high (14th place) in the categories Institutions and Business Sophistication, and is ranked first when it comes to the use of information and communication technologies, electricity output, share of gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) financed from abroad, number of scientific articles published per capita, national feature films, and online creativity. On the other hand, Iceland scores low when it comes to the ratio of gross-domestic-product (GDP)-to-energy-use (129th), a proxy for energy efficiency; the size of the domestic market (129th); the value of inward direct investment made by non-resident investors (127th); and graduates in science and engineering (85th). As noted in a recent article in Iceland Review magazine, Iceland may have “hopped on the startup train a bit later than other countries, but its startup environment has taken huge strides in recent years.” In 2019, the Icelandic government penned its first-ever comprehensive innovation policy, and at the end of 2020, the newly-elected government established a Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation, suggesting that policymakers are “not overlooking what startups have to offer the nation.”","Business,Sci&Tech,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

Although this may sound like a good development, according to the Federation of Trade and Services, hiring new staff has never been more difficult for Icelandic employers. In a statement to RÚV, Landsbankinn economist Una Jónsdóttir said that instead of employees competing for jobs, it is now the case that employers are competing for staff. In total, around 5,400 were unemployed in September, largely representing the retail, service, transportation, and restaurant industries. Of these 5,400, 44% are reported to be foreign residents in Iceland. In comparison with the total unemployment rate for Iceland of 2.8%, the unemployment rate for foreigners is double, at 5.6%. Iceland’s Suðurnes region is notable as having an especially high unemployment rate of 4.8%, with the capital region sitting around 3.2%. Icelandic unemployment is lowest in the Northwest, which has only 0.7%.

679,Iceland Review,Hopes for New ASÍ Leadership Amidst Contract Negotiations,2022/10/06,"With many labour contracts expiring at the end of October, pressure is mounting on the current round of negotiations. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, acting chairman of ASÍ after Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year, has stated that a major issue at ASÍ’s upcoming conference will of course be wage increases, but that choosing new leadership will play an equally important role. Drífa’s departure earlier this year caused some turmoil within ASÍ leadership, which Kristján states has unfortunately turned the energies of the association towards inward power struggles, not outward to the wage negotiations. So far, VR president Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson is the only one to announce their candidacy for ASÍ president, but there still remains the opportunity for individuals to announce their candidacy at the conference. Another debated issue in the current negotiations is the role of the state mediator. Kristján is on record calling for a simplified process by which unions can call for strikes, giving them relatively more power at the bargaining table. Notably, many other trade unions in the Nordic nations also allow for leadership to call unilaterally for a strike, circumventing the need for union-wide votes. Kristján has called for such reforms to the strike process in lieu of strengthening the role of the state mediator. The wage negotiations take place against the backdrop of an ever-rising cost of living in Iceland. Main contributing factors include inflation and rising interest rates that have seen mortgage payments increase significantly this year. Yesterday, the Central Bank announced a .25% increase to the interest rate. Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the Central Bank, warned that the course of inflation in Iceland was largely up to the labour market. The rate increase could be interpreted as an attempt to dissuade negotiators from too-ambitious of wage increases, as they may drive inflation further.  ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
680,Iceland Review,Policy Aims to Promote Transparency in Iceland’s Fishing Industry,2022/10/06,"A new government initiative spearheaded by Svandís Svavarsdóttir, head of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, aims to bring comprehensive policy reforms and transparency to the fishing industry. The initiative, entitled Auðlindin Okkar (Our Resource), arose out of several working groups that were commissioned earlier in the year in line with the Agreement on the Platform for the Coalition Government between the Independence Party, the Left Green Movement, and the Progressive Party. In the coalition charter, it states the following regarding fisheries: “A committee will be appointed to map the challenges and opportunities in fisheries and related sectors and to assess the macroeconomic benefits of the fisheries management system. The committee will be tasked with comparing the situation in Iceland and abroad and submitting proposals to maximise Icelanders’ potential for further success and societal consensus on the framework of the sector. The committee will also discuss how transparency in fisheries companies’ operations can be increased, especially among the country’s largest companies. In addition, the committee will evaluate the success of employment and regional quotas and summer inshore handline fishing in supporting the rural economy.” In the estimation of these working groups, the time has come for a new approach. Earlier this year, Svandís stated that “there is a deep feeling of injustice among the public […] I think that feeling stems mainly from two things; the consolidation of quota and the feeling that the profits from the shared resource of the people are not divided fairly. The aim of this work is therefore efficient and sustainable utilisation of marine resources in harmony with the environment and society.” Now, Our Resource aims to shine daylight on a very powerful sector of the Icelandic economy that some say borders on oligarchy. There are, for instance, just four companies that collectively own 60% of all Iceland’s fishing quota: Samherji, Brim, KS, and Ísfélagið. A central aim of the initiative will be a thorough mapping of the management and ownership of Iceland’s major fishing concerns. Many details of the property relations in these concerns remain in the dark, and Our Resource hopes to be able to better supervise the industry. According to the government website, “[t]he inspection is primarily intended to increase transparency and improve administration in the field of monitoring management and ownership relationships in the maritime industry. The examination includes the collection of information and the mapping of the property relationships of fishing companies that have been allocated a certain amount of fishing permits and the influence of fishing company owners through the exercise of voting rights and board seats in companies.” This initial mapping report on the industry is to be published by December 31, 2022.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
681,Iceland Review,Key Interest Rates Increased .25%,2022/10/05,"Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Icelandic Central Bank, announced today in a presentation that key interest rates would be raised again by .25%. Now sitting at 5.75% for seven-day term deposits, the interest rate is a its highest level since 2016. Interest rates have risen sharply in recent months to combat inflation, which peaked at 9.9% in July of this year. It has since dropped to 9.3%, still well above the Central Bank’s target of 2.5%. In the announcement on the Central Bank’s website, it states that “indicators suggest that recent interest rate hikes have slowed overall demand growth and housing market activity. Headline inflation measured 9.3% in September and has fallen by 0.6 percentage points since the MPC’s August meeting. Underlying inflation rose between meetings, however. There are also signs that inflation expectations have begun to decline again, although they are still above the Bank’s inflation target.” For the first half of 2022, GDP grew at a strong rate of 6.8%, but slowdowns are expected in the winter months. The announcement also states that “the global economic outlook has deteriorated and uncertainty has grown, which could cause domestic demand to ease more quickly than previously assumed.” The Central Bank remains hopeful that inflation can be brought back down to acceptable levels within a reasonable timeframe, but stresses that many of the decisions driving inflation will be made at the corporate level, in the labour market, and in public sector finances.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0

The company, Könglar (meaning ‘pine cones’), has been selling its beverages at restaurants throughout East Iceland since earlier this year and aims to be a truly local product. “People are always asking us if it’s possible to get [our drinks] in the [capital area],” says marketing manager Brynjar Darri Sigurðsson. “And we always say, ‘no, you have to come out East.’” Producer Dagrún Drótt Valgarðsdóttir got the idea for making natural beverages from local, Icelandic ingredients after sampling a blueberry drink made in Finland. “We started to wonder if we could use that method using the nature we have here,” she says. Könglar received subsidies from the municipality of Fljótsdalshérað, as well as the government’s Food Fund, which aims to “strengthen development and innovation in the production and processing of food and by-products from agricultural and marine products,” with an emphasis “on innovation, sustainability, value creation and the competitiveness of Icelandic food throughout the country.” Thus far, the company’s beverages, all of which have names inspired by local folk tales, include a lovage drink, a dandelion iced tea, and a rhubarb soda. Dagrún says their focus has been “to use what’s around us as much as possible” instead of opting for imported produce or ingredients that aren’t native to Iceland. So, for instance, if they want the flavor profile of a tart, green apple, they use rhubarb, which is plentiful in East Iceland. In the future, Dagrún says Könglar would like to use their same production and infusion methods to make herbal-flavored beers and wine. Follow Könglar on Instagram, here.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
683,Iceland Review,Inflation Rate Drops to 9.3%,2022/09/28,"The latest numbers from Statistics Iceland indicate a moderate decrease in the rate of inflation, with the 12-month figure being calculated as 9.3% in September. The data from Statistics Iceland below shows monthly and yearly fluctuations in the consumer price index, with July’s level of 9.9% representing a likely maximum. In the data from Statistics Iceland, it is noted that the price of clothes and shoes have risen by some 4.6%, and household electronics by 5.4%. Airfares have been a notable exception, decreasing by 17.9%. Given rising interest rates and the importance of the housing market in driving inflation, inflation rates are expected to slowly decrease for the remainder of 2022. This trend is likely reinforced by the housing market, which has shown signs of slowing recently. A statement from the Central Bank today notes that inflation among Iceland’s trading partners has not been higher in decades and that these international trends may also have a negative impact on Iceland. Nevertheless, the Central Bank stresses that “the resilience of the systemically important banks is high. Their capital and liquidity position is strong. The Central Bank of Iceland’s stress test for 2022 shows that the banks have the ability to respond to external shocks and at the same time support households and businesses.” The statement continues: “Increased external uncertainty underlines the importance of maintaining the resilience of the Icelandic financial system. The situation in this country is better than in our trading partners, but full vigilance must be maintained in order to preserve financial stability.” Up until now, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), the amount of liquid capital a financial institution holds in case of stress, has remained unchanged. As of tomorrow, September 29, the CCyB will be increased by 2%, in the event that more credit needs to be provided to the economy in the event of a downturn.  ",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

685,Iceland Review,2023 Budget to Include 7.7% Hike on Alcohol,2022/09/15,"In the latest draft of the 2023 budget, a 7.7% increase in alcohol tax is proposed. Iceland already has some of the highest alcohol taxes in the world, and critics within the restaurant industry claim that the latest tax hikes will make Iceland less attractive as a tourist destination, and put unnecessary stress on an already-struggling industry. In a report by the Icelandic Federation of Trade, it is stated that under the new tax structure, a common box of wine will increase on average by ISK 600, a bottle of liquor by some ISK 700, and a six-pack of beer some ISK 150. Especially affected will be alcohol sales in Duty Free, which are currently taxed at the lower rate of 10%. Under the new structure, alcohol taxes will be raised to 25%, a 150% increase. In Duty Free, the same box of wine will increase by ISK 1,800, a bottle of liquor by ISK 2,300, and a six-pack of beer by ISK 240. In an editorial on Vísir, Aðalgeir Ásvaldsson, director of the Association of Companies in the Restaurant Industry (SVEIT), states that the increased taxes will have to be built into prices, which will in turn contribute to high inflation. Aðalgeir critiqued the new budget plan, saying that high public fees and COVID restrictions have been extremely damaging to the industry which is so important to tourism. “The restaurant industry wants to contribute to society,” Aðalgeir stated. “We offer good food and drinks, create thousands of jobs and play an important role in shaping the culture of the country. We have had to endure much recently, but now enough is enough.” Currently, 92% of the price of a bottle of liquor comes from state taxes, compared to 73% of the price of a bottle of wine, and 61% of the price of a can of beer. As the budget draft currently stands, the tax hike on alcohol would represent an increase in ISK 1.64 billion to the treasury, and total income from alcohol tax for 2023 is projected to sit around ISK 25 billion. The 2023 budget proposal has also come under recent critique for new taxes and fees levied on fuel, road tolls, vehicle imports, and other costs of owning a vehicle in Iceland. The increased taxes will represent a 36% increase in state revenues from transportation, but critics say that the increased prices will hurt the lowest-income Icelanders, with no accompanying expansion of public transportation. Despite the tax increases, however, the budget is still expected to yield a deficit of some ISK 89 billion, an improvement over the previous year’s ISK 169 billion deficit.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
686,Iceland Review,Iceland’s Low-Cost Electricity in High Demand as Energy Prices Skyrocket in Europe,2022/09/11,"There is an increasing demand amongst foreign companies to base their operations in Iceland due to favourable energy prices, but the demand far exceeds what the country’s power plants can produce. RÚV reports that Landsvirkjun, the National Power Company of Iceland, says there’s a pressing need for increased electricity production. ‘New, potential customers are knocking on the door’ With Russia cutting off petrol pipelines to Europe, energy prices on the continent are skyrocketing. Meanwhile in Iceland, energy prices have remained almost unchanged. “It’s our renewable energy that makes this possible,” says Tinna Traustadóttir, Executive Vice President of Sales at Landsvirkjun. And as gas prices continue to rise, it’s not only consumers, but also companies, that are suffering. This has led to many enterprises—not least energy-guzzling aluminium smelters—going under as a result. The state of Europe’s changing energy landscape is “reflected in high demand from existing customers,” explains Tinna, “and we also feel that there are new, potential customers knocking on the door.” At present, however, Iceland has no electricity to spare. “As it stands now, you could say our electricity system is at full capacity, or as close to that as possible. And of course, it takes time to generate a new supply, but the situation is a pressing one,” says Tinna. ‘We will need to prioritize…but it’s clear we need to accelerate’ As a result, many foreign companies are clamouring to relocate their operations in Iceland, but the demand not only far exceeds the country’s current energy supply, it also exceeds Landsvirkjun’s plans for future  electricity production. “We will need to prioritize,” says Tinna, listing off Landsvirkjun’s competing energy interests. “Domestic energy exchange, domestic food production, technological progress, supporting our current customers. But it’s clear we need to accelerate.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
687,Iceland Review,Rising Production Costs Lead to Historically Low Mutton Stocks,2022/09/08,"Agricultural newspaper Bændablaðið reports that Iceland’s stocks of mutton have reached a historic low. According to recently published statistics, the slaughter season has never before begun with as little stored mutton as this year. Stocks at the end of July were recorded at 767 tonnes, with monthly sales of around 500 tonnes. Decreased production of mutton is attributed to several factors this year, including rising costs and fewer animals slaughtered this year. These forces have combined to lead to an all-time low in stocks of mutton, although officials will not have a complete picture until mid-September, when slaughterhouses have submitted their status reports on stock levels. Ágúst Torfi Hauksson, CEO of Kjarnafæði Norðlenska, has cautioned that the numbers ought to be seen in context. He stated to Bændablaðið: “Mutton has been very cheap on the market and perhaps much cheaper than it should be based on production costs. Icelanders are used to the price of this product, and therefore a considerable increase could lead to less demand. But consumers should still bear in mind that it is in their interest that sheep farmers are paid. If farmers are paid so little that they are forced to stop farming, then this could also lead to a shortage of lamb meat.” According to Ágúst, the market is actually in good condition at the moment, with the price of mutton reflecting a balance of the supply and demand. Like many other industries, production costs have risen sharply in the last year. Combined with inflation, it is natural for prices to rise significantly. The question seems to be whether consumers will accept this, and whether demand will adjust itself accordingly.  ","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
688,Iceland Review,Recent Halt in Domestic French Fry Production Raises Questions Concerning Tariffs,2022/09/08,"When Icelandic frozen- and ready-made food company Þykkvabæjar stopped producing french fries earlier this summer, they were the last remaining producer of the popular side dish in Iceland. Now, with no domestic producers left, all french fries in Iceland must be imported. The lack of domestic production, however, has raised questions over what, exactly, protectionist tariffs are protecting. In a recent report by the National Association of Employers, it came to light that Icelandic consumers have paid a total of ISK 800 million in french fry tariffs in the past two and a half years. Those imported from Canada and the EU are taxed at a rate of 46%, and french fries from elsewhere are taxed at a much higher 76%. Given the growing share of the tourism and service industries, this cost is not trivial. The National Association of Employers has petitioned the Minister of Finance to repeal the tariffs, stating that they no longer protect anything and only hurt the consumer. Ólafur Stephensen, managing director of the National Association of Employers, has cited the french fry tariff as one more unnecessary burden. During a time of high inflation, he stated, such burdens should be minimized as far as possible: “These numbers clearly show that there is a lot at stake for Icelandic consumers, the trade and the restaurant sector to abolish this protectionist tariff that no longer protects anything. The duties amount to 300-400 million per year and at a time when food prices are constantly rising, such sums make a difference.” Ólafur, along with other consumer-advocacy groups, has since called on the Minister of Finance to repeal the tariff.    ","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
689,Iceland Review,Salmon Fished in Westfjords Rivers Likely Escaped from Farms,2022/08/31,"Salmon that were caught in the Westfjords recently are suspected to be escapees from open sea salmon farms in the region, a notice from the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) states. The fish were reported to MAST on August 26 and samples are now being analysed to determine their origin. Escaped salmon poses a risk to wild salmon populations, as cross-breeding could diminish wild salmon’s chances of survival. Iceland’s aquaculture industry has been expanding rapidly in recent years. While some aquaculture is practiced on land, the majority of fish farms in Iceland are open-net sea farms. Such farms now operate in several of the Westfjords: Dýrafjörður, Arnarfjörður, Tálknafjörður, and Patreksfjörður. The industry’s expansion has not been without opposition from environmental groups and local residents. In 2019, a petition signed by 18,000 people calling for a stop to open-net fish farming was handed over to the Icelandic Parliament. There have been previous instances of escaped farmed salmon caught in the wild in Iceland, including as early as 2018. MAST will publish more information on the fish once their DNA has been sequenced.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
690,Iceland Review,Signs that Inflation May Have Peaked in Iceland,2022/08/31,"Inflation measured 9.7% in August, a drop from 9.9% in July and the first drop in inflation rates since June of last year. The housing market appears to be cooling as well, for which the Central Bank’s interest rate hikes of recent months are likely partially responsible. The Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland says it’s too early to declare victory against inflation, but there are signs that things are heading in the right direction. “We’re seeing that the real estate component is rising much less than it has in recent months and that indicates that we are seeing a cooling of the real estate market,” Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson told RÚV. “Then there are other factors that are working in our favour; a drop in the price of oil, raw material prices have been dropping abroad and that is helping us. So hopefully these measures, our interest rates hikes and other things, are having an impact.” Just last week, the Central Bank projected that inflation would continue to rise. “I hope that this time around we’ve overestimated inflation and that it’s going to be lower than we projected. That would be very positive,” Ásgeir stated. It is, nevertheless, too early to declare victory against inflation, Ásgeir stated. “This maybe does not impact out long term projections yet. It shows promise, but our work is not done. We of course still have an economy that is growing considerably and is heating up.” According to newly-released figures from Statistics Iceland, the country’s GDP increased by 4.4% in 2021 and by 6.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Growth in the second quarter is largely attributed to increased private consumption and a large increase in the arrival of tourists to Iceland compared to the same period last year. The growth in tourism appears set to continue: overnight stays in July of this year exceeded all previous years, with 82% of stays attributed to foreign tourists.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
691,Iceland Review,Scrapie-Resistant Sheep to Enter Market this Fall,2022/08/30,"Up to 15 rams with scrapie-resistant genes will be sold for breeding this fall. Bred in Reyðarfjörður in East Iceland, the sheep carry a special gene and it is hoped that they will help form a more resilient stock in Iceland. The gene, called ARR, is not found anywhere else in Iceland. It has been recognised internationally as scrapie-resistant, and herds with the ARR gene have already been bred in Europe for some two decades. Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease found in sheep and goats, the ovine equivalent of mad cow disease. There is no cure, and even one case of scrapie can be a death sentence for an entire agricultural community. If a sheep tests positive for scrapie, the entire herd is culled, the entire farm’s hay must be destroyed, and the entire farm and its implements must be sanitised, either chemically or through fire. Even after this deep-cleaning, farmers are not able to raise sheep for a set time, and the scorched-earth policy may even affect neighboring herds and farms. After the ARR gene was found out East, an effort was made to breed the gene into the stock as much as possible. There are now some 50 total rams that carry the gene. Steinn Björnsson, a farmer in Reyðarfjörður, has said that the rams are expected to go for a modest amount. In an interview with RÚV, he stated “after all, sheep farmers have so little money that they would never be able to buy this if they were any more expensive.” In a recent statement on their website, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority has designated priority zones for the resistant stock. With only a small supply of the so-called “golden rams,” the stock is to be used as effectively as possible, with farming communities recently affected by scrapie and with herds of 300 or more given first priority. For the full story on the fight against scrapie and the efforts to breed this new, resistant stock, read more in our article: Good Breeding. ","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
692,Iceland Review,Mortgage Payments to Continue Rising in Iceland,2022/08/29,"Steep interest rate hikes from Iceland’s Central Bank mean that many Icelandic families face much higher mortgage payments than they did one year ago. Doctor of Economics Ólafur Margeirsson, however, does not recommend those with non-indexed loans to refinance to indexed loans. Ólafur says ensuring more housing supply will be key in regulating the housing market. The debt load of non-indexed loans in Iceland has risen by over ISK 100,000 [$709; €708] per month, in the case of an ISK 50 million loan with a variable interest rate of 3.4% taken in early 2021. “There are quite a few families who can’t afford an additional ISK 100,000 a month,” Ólafur told RÚV, saying there were two ways out of the housing market’s difficulties. “Firstly, we must encourage more supply of that which is lacking. And there is a lack of real estate in Iceland. There is a housing shortage so we must build more and continue building more. The other thing is limiting access to indexed loans in order for interest rate hikes to work.” Inflation has risen to 9.9% in Iceland, and the Central Bank Governor has stated that the bank will continue raising interest rates as much as necessary to tackle inflation. Ólafur did not recommend borrowers with non-indexed loans refinance over to indexed loans. “Remember that the principal on indexed loans increases. Try to pay off debts as quickly as you can, because then the impact will be less when the interest rate changes in the future.” Ólafur added that housing would be a big issue in the coming wage negotiations this fall, suggesting that one solution is for “Icelandic pension funds, like pension funds in Europe, to invest in building new apartments in order to rent them out. With that, we are systematically increasing the supply of real estate, we are reducing pressure on rental prices, reducing the pressure on real estate prices, and with that, we are reducing inflationary pressure and interest rate pressure as well. This is a key point that must be discussed in wage negotiations.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
693,Iceland Review,Key Interest Rate Raised to 5.5% in Iceland,2022/08/24,"The Central Bank of Iceland’s key interest rate will be raised by 0.75% to 5.5%, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee announced today. The hike was expected by industry experts and continues a trend of tightening monetary policy in response to inflation and market conditions. GDP in Iceland is set to measure nearly 6% this year, according to the Central Bank’s updated forecast, some 1.3% higher than the May forecast. This is due to more robust private consumption growth and a more rapid rebound in tourism than was projected earlier this year. Job numbers continue to rise in Iceland and unemployment to fall. While the economic outlook has improved, the inflation outlook has continued to deteriorate, the Central Bank reports. Inflation rose to 9.9% in July and is forecast to peak at 11% late this year. The bleaker outlook “reflects stronger economic activity than was forecast in ay, as well as more persistent house price inflation and higher global inflation,” the statement from the Monetary Policy Committee reads. The MPC added it was likely that the monetary stance will be tightened even further “so as to ensure that inflation eases back to target within an acceptable time frame.” Iceland’s Central Bank lowered interest rates repeatedly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with the stated aims of bolstering the economy and maintaining stability on the housing market. Rates reached a historic low of 0.75% in November 2020, but the Central Bank began raising rates steadily once more in early 2021.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
694,Iceland Review,Annual List of Highest Tax Payers in Iceland Published,2022/08/23,"The financial journal Frjáls Verslun has recently published their annual list of Iceland’s highest tax payers, compiled from public information available in the tax registry. Number one on the list this year is Björn Erlingur Jónasson, former owner of Valafell ehf., a shipping company which he owned together with his wife, Kristína Vigfúsdóttir. The vast majority of the taxes paid, ISK 689 million of a total of 692 million, were from the sale of Valafell to KG Fiskverkun. Another noteworthy member of Iceland’s “tax kings” is Haraldur Þorleifsson, former owner of tech company Ueno, which he sold to Twitter in 2021. Haraldur paid some ISK 592 million in tax for the sale, making him the highest tax payer in Reykjavík. However, this honorary status was taken on by choice, as Haraldur negotiated during the sale to pay tax in Iceland, and for the majority of the sale to paid in wages. This choice placed the realized profit in a much higher tax bracket, as wages are taxed at 46% in Iceland, whereas capital gains income is taxed at a much lower rate of 22%. Haraldur has been an activist for increased accessibility for the disabled in public spaces, and he has stated in an interview with Stundin that he was happy to give back to the society which provided him with his education. Despite being the highest tax-payer, however, Haraldur is far from the highest earner in Iceland. Stundin has criticized the list as giving an incomplete picture of wealth and inequality in Iceland. According to Stundin, in placing the emphasis on wage, the annual list hides income from capital gains, and thereby obscures the true centers of wealth in Iceland. For example, the annual list places many of the CEO’s of Iceland’s shipping companies relatively low, as they take relatively modest monthly wages home. However, their total financial assets often represent figures in the hundreds of millions of ISK. As these sources of income are taxed at a much lower rate, the list could be said to present an incomplete view of income in Iceland. Similarly, the tax report only includes individual income. Many of Iceland’s top earners, including artists, lawyers, and businessmen, make significant portions of their income through partnerships, cooperatives, and other organizations that are registered as separate tax entities. The annual list also discloses a gender imbalance within the nation’s top earners. The first woman on the list, Kristín Guðríður Jóhannsdóttir, is to be found in 21st place. Within the top 50 earners in Iceland, only five women are represented.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
695,Iceland Review,Minister of Food Allocates ISK 584.6 Million from Food Fund,2022/08/19,"Svandís Svavarsdóttir, Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, has allocated ISK 584.6 million ($4.2 million /€4.1 million) from the Food Fund (Matvælasjóður). Fifty-eights projects, from 211 applications in total, received grants. Among the projects that received grants: – The development of delicacies from lamb and sheep riblets
– A marketing initiative for the export of Icelandic whiskey
– A project to maximise the productivity of home food growing systems for local vegetable production
– Potable supplements made from Icelandic algae
– A system of supervision and certification for Icelandic salt-fish products
– Protein manufacturing from Icelandic grass
– The development of flavouring products from algae for oriental food
– Foal jerky and raw sausages “The creativity and daring that Icelandic food manufacturers possess is a reason for rejoicing and goes to show that Iceland is on the right course as a food manufacturer. It’s also great to see that the gender ratio is almost even,” Svandís stated. The Food Fund awards subsidies in four categories: Bára, Kelda, Afurð, and Fjársjóður. Bára supports projects at the idea stage. Eligible grantees include companies that have been founded over the past five years, along with entrepreneurs that want to develop ideas, raw materials, or processes related to Icelandic food manufacture. Kelda supports projects that aim to acquire knowledge in support of the fund’s aims of innovation, sustainability, value creation, and the competitiveness of Iceland as a food manufacturer. Afurð supports projects that are beyond the idea phase but are not yet ready to go to market. Subsidies aim to afford grantees opportunities to develop products from raw materials created during the manufacturing process and that are conducive to the creation of value. Fjársjóður supports projects that aim to support Iceland’s marketing infrastructure and that support marketing campaigns for products connected to Icelandic food manufacture. As noted on the government’s website, the aim of the Food Fund is to support innovation in the field of food production and processing,whether agricultural or marine-product related. The fund emphasises innovation, sustainability, value-creation, and the competitiveness of Icelandic food products.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
696,Iceland Review,Vík Mayor Wants to Build Harbour for Sand Mine,2022/08/18,"Iceland’s Minister of the Environment and Energy opposes plans to transport sand from a planned sand mine in South Iceland by truck along the Ring Road. Residents have expressed opposition to the plans, which would see large trucks driving at 7- to 8- minute intervals along the Ring Road in South Iceland 24 hours per day. The mayor of Vík, just 15 km west of the mine’s planned location, has proposed building a harbour in the town from which the sand could be exported. “Everyone knows that there is a lot of strain on infrastructure as it is, and putting heavy transport on top of that is something that I don’t think there will ever be agreement on,” Environment Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson stated. “Whichever way you look at it, adding to these roads and through these settlements is not going to work.” In 2020, German company EP Power Minerals purchased a large property in South Iceland, around 15 km [9.3 mi] east of the town of Vík í Mýrdal. The property mostly consists of sand plains and the company plans to establish a sand mine on it. The sand would be exported to Europe and possibly North America, where it will be used as an additive in cement. A recently-published environmental report on the proposed mine judged the project’s impact on traffic and roads to be “considerably negative.” Its climate impact, however, was evaluated as “considerably positive,” as the material produced would replace cement clinker and reduce carbon emissions due to concrete production by 800 million kg of CO2 equivalents annually. Einar Freyr Elínarson, Mayor of Mýrdalshreppur municipality (in which Vík is located), has proposed building a harbour in Vík from which the mined materials could be exported. “Route 1 passes through several urban areas on the way to Þorlákshöfn [the planned export harbour]. So we in the municipality propose looking into the possibility of shipping all of this out from here on the coast, and building a harbour,” Einar told Vísir. Vík is the only coastal town in Iceland that doesn’t have a harbour, but the south coast’s strong waves post challenges in such construction projects. The nearby Landeyjarhöfn harbour, from which the Westman Islands ferry departs, fills with sand that must be pumped out regularly. Einar says he has proposed the idea to EP Power Minerals representatives who have not expressed direct opposition to the idea. The harbour would not be built using public funds, Einar says, calling it an “exciting opportunity” for the municipality, as well as the local tourism and fishing industries.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
697,Iceland Review,Proposed Sand Mine Would Operate Trucks at 7- to 8-Minute Intervals Along Ring Road,2022/08/16,"Large transport trucks could be driving along Iceland’s South Coast at 7- to 8-minute intervals – 24 hours a day – if German company EP Power Minerals’ plan to open a sand mine east of Vík is realised. The sand would be exported to Europe and possibly North America, where it would be used as an additive in cement. The company plans to ship the material from Þorlákshöfn, but the local mayor says the town does not have adequate facilities for its storage and EP Power Minerals is yet to apply for a lot in the harbour. An environmental evaluation of the proposal published earlier this month judged the project’s impact on traffic and noise pollution to be “considerably negative.” Its impact on birdlife, plant life, and the geology of the area was, however, evaluated as “insignificantly negative.” EP Power Minerals purchased the land where the proposed mine is to be located in 2020. Some 15 km [9.3 mi] east of Vík í Mýrdal, the property stretches from Kötlujökull glacier down to the coast, and consists mostly of sand plains. The property was listed for sale in 2016 by its former owners, three siblings who have stated that they made several unsuccessful attempts to sell it to the Icelandic state. The land was sold to EP Power Minerals through the company Mýrdalssandur ehf., in which three Icelanders own a 10% share (through the company Lásastígur ehf.). The proposed mine would be located by Hafursey mountain and north of the Ring Road, which runs through the property. The proposed mining area covers 15.5 square kilometres and it is estimated that the usable sand within the area measures around 146 million cubic metres. According to the mining plans, there should be enough material within that area for 100 years of mining. EP Power Minerals plans to transport the sand by truck to Þorlákshöfn. The amount of material would entail a full truck leaving the mine every 15 minutes, and empty trucks returning from Þorlákshöfn at the same rate. This means that transport trucks will be driving at 7-8 minute intervals 24 hours a day along the ring road between Vík and Hveragerði, as well as on the roads between Hveragerði and Þorlákshöfn. Residents of the capital area and South Iceland have expressed concern at the impact this transport would have on traffic and roads in the area. Jóhannes Þór Skúlason, CEO of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association, also expressed concern about the impact the mine and its associated traffic would have. “There has been talk about the tourism industry in that regard, but it’s recognised that one heavy truck such as those that transport fish between regions, it damages the road to the equivalent of 10,000 Yaris cars or small rental cars,” Jóhannes Þór told Vísir, expressing doubt as to whether road infrastructure could handle so much heavy transport. He added that a project such as the mine would affect the experience of tourists in the area. The environmental evaluation conducted by Efla and published earlier this month judged many of the mine’s negative impacts to be negligible. Its impact on plant life and birdlife in the area was considered “insignificantly negative,” as the sand plains in question are not a habitat for endangered or protected plant species and the mine would not greatly impact nesting areas. Despite the fact that the mine would have a “direct and permanent effect on the sedimentation of Mýrdalssandur,” the effect would only be on a “tiny percentage of the total formation,” lowering the surface by 10 metres at a site where the sand is 120 metres thick. Therefore, Efla’s assessment was that the overall impact on geological formations would be “insignificantly negative.” The same was determined of the mine’s impact on tourism and outdoor recreation in the area. The project’s climate impact was considered to be “considerably positive,” as the material produced would replace cement clinker and would therefore reduce carbon emissions due to concrete production by 800 million kg of CO2 equivalents annually (when emissions due to transportation are taken into account).","Business,Nature,Society",1,0,1,0,1,0
698,Iceland Review,"Drífa Snædal, President of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, Steps Down",2022/08/10,"Drífa Snædal, president of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, has announced today that she is stepping down from her post. Citing the formation of certain blocs within the confederation and difficult relations with elected representatives, Drífa stated that it was impossible for her to continue working as president. Upcoming salary negotiations and the annual conference in October were identified as reasons to step down sooner, rather than later. The announcement can be found below in a Facebook post from the Icelandic Confederation of Labour. In her statement, Drífa said that as president, she found herself in situations she had never expected. Specifically, she pointed out how Efling’s mass layoffs earlier this year forced her to publicly criticize Efling chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir for her decision. According to Drífa, the Icelandic Confederation of Labour had been working against such mass layoffs for some time, and that Sólveig’s actions put her in a very difficult position. Given the internal divisions, she said, it was impossible to move forward. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, chairperson of the Icelandic Electrical Industry Association and vice-president of the Icelandic Labour Confederation, is slated to take over Drífa’s now-vacant position until the coming conference in October. In a statement to Morgunblaðið, Kristján said that the situation was still very fresh, and that he had not decided whether he would run for the presidency at the conference in October. Having just received the news this morning, he said that although Drífa would be missed, it was naturally his task to step in and fill her role until more permanent decisions could be made. The Icelandic Confederation of Labour consists of 46 trade unions and represents service workers, seamen, construction workers, office and retail workers, and several other industries in Iceland. It is the largest union confederation in Iceland, representing 2/3 of Icelandic organized labour, or around 133,000 workers. Approximately 80% of Icelandic labour is organized in trade unions, the largest of which are VR, with c. 40,000 members, and Efling, with c. 30,000 members. Concluding her announcement, Drífa called the labour movement the “most remarkable human rights movements in the world.” She continued: “However, I can no longer perform my duties as president of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour. It’s best to end things here. And to remove any doubt, this is not part of some larger scheme, I am simply leaving this platform with no intention of returning. I thank my supporters from the bottom of my heart and ask for their understanding in this decision.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
699,Iceland Review,"July Sees Large Increase in Flights from Icelandair, Play",2022/08/09,"In recent press releases, both of Iceland’s international airlines, Icelandair and PLAY, have reported significant increases in passenger counts in July 2022. In the previous month, Icelandair’s total international and domestic passenger count was 529,000, representing a 141% increase from July 2021, which saw only 219,000. June 2022 saw some 431,000 passengers. The July totals for 2022 are 89% of the July 2019 numbers, signaling a recovery in the travel industry from COVD-19. However, Icelandair has not been immune to the many travel disruptions caused by difficult conditions in international airports, with a 64% on-time performance rate. Icelandair is not unique in this, and many other airlines have reported similar problems as travel has begun resuming at pre-pandemic levels. Many international airports had to lay off staff during the pandemic, and are only now beginning to work again at full capacity. An influx of new, untrained staff and sudden ramp-up in operations has resulted in many reports of lost baggage and delayed flights. A highlight for Icelandair is a load capacity of 89.6%, which they state reflects both a well-optimized route network, and also the pent-up travel demand from COVID-19. The story is much the same for Iceland’s most recent budget airline, PLAY. July 2022 saw PLAY servicing some 110,000 passengers, an increase of 25% from the previous month’s 88,000. Notably, the recent July figure is greater than PLAY’s entire 2021 year. PLAY has enjoyed a passenger load of 87.9%, an increase of June’s figure of 79.2% and May’s 69.6%. As in the case of Icelandair, this likely reflects a pent-up travel demand following relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions. The budget airline has also enjoyed a comparatively higher on-time performance rate of 79%, which is seen as particularly impressive given the difficult situation seen in many international airports. July 2022 also saw the introduction of PLAY’s latest aircraft, and Airbus A320neo, bringing their total fleet to six.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0

Icelanders had the second most overnight bookings in June 2022, or 91,388 to be exact. Percentage-wise, this is the most significant increase by nationality since the pre-pandemic years. Germans had the third most bookings by total in June 2022: 58,453, or a 27% increase from the 46,170 overnight stays they booked in June 2019. In terms of percentage increases, however, Italians had the next highest increase in overnight June bookings after Icelanders: 11,728 in June 2022, or an increase of 89% from 6,200 in June 2019. The new figures show that between June of this year and last year, 2021, occupancy rates around Iceland went up from 40% to 78.8%. Regionally, the biggest jump in hotel bookings was, unsurprisingly, in the capital region, with 5,400 hotel rooms booked in 2022 versus 3,277 in 2021. The second largest increase was seen in the Southwest: 1,017 in 2022, up from 880 in 2021. East Iceland has seen the least change in overnight stays in the last year, with only two more overnight stays booked in 2022 (441) than in 2021 (439).

701,Iceland Review,No Small Potatoes: Local Spud Farmers Hopeful For This Year’s Harvest,2022/07/28,"Potato farmers in Þykkvabær, the spud capital of Iceland, have high hopes for a good harvest this year, RÚV reports. This despite the presence of some potato blight, a fungus that wreaked havoc on last year’s potato crop. Farmers say that if the weather remains good and sprouting goes well, domestic potato production will be sufficient throughout the year. Potato farmer Markús Ársælsson says this hasn’t been the case in recent years, but he’s still hopeful for this year’s prospects. “It’s gone just fine and the outlook’s really good, but you never know until the end of the day what the result is going to be,” he remarked. “We might have a frost in August. But as things stand right now, it’s looking good.” Potato blight is a major concern for farmers in Iceland, Markús agrees. “Yes, it rears its ugly head when weather conditions are like this and we’ve started spraying just to be on the safe side and that’s going pretty well. We’re hoping, just crossing our fingers, that nothing comes up now that makes this summer like the one last year, which was brutal. Because even though we sprayed them, for some reason, nothing helped with anything.” Farmers take measures to ensure that their potatoes sprout as quickly and prolifically as possible, but growth does sometimes slow, which can make competing with imported potatoes even more difficult, says Markús. Growth delays on the domestic market means that Icelandic grocery stores will import potatoes and then want to sell off all their imported product before looking to buy more potatoes from domestic producers. “It’s awful, of course,” said Markús. “Customers aren’t offered fresh Icelandic [potatoes], rather it’s ‘we’re going to finish off the old imported ones and then we’ll come back to all of you [Icelandic potato farmers].” Over the years, domestic potato production has ranged from 7,000 tons all the way up to 12,000 tons in a particularly good year.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
702,Iceland Review,Controversial Telecommunications Company Sale Up in the Air,2022/07/18,"French company Ardian is not prepared to finalise its purchase of Icelandic telecommunications company Míla unless the purchase agreement is amended, RÚV reports. Iceland’s Competition Authority set several conditions for the purchase following a meeting with Ardian representatives last week, informing the company that the purchase would not be approved unless those conditions were met. Ardian’s spokespeople say that one of the conditions contradicts the terms of the purchase agreement. Míla, which owns and operates nationwide telecommunications systems in Iceland, was sold to Ardian last year. All of Iceland’s homes, businesses, and institutions are serviced by Míla’s telecommunications infrastructure, which includes copper wire, fibreoptic, and microwave systems. The purchase agreement from last October was evaluated at ISK 78 billion [$570 million; €562 million]. Various parties in Iceland have expressed concern regarding the sale of such important infrastructure to a foreign company. Iceland’s government imposed certain conditions on the sale as well as amending legislation in an effort to ensure national security would not be compromised by Ardian’s ownership of Míla. Ardian A notice from Síminn to Nasdaq Iceland stated that the Competition Authority’s conditions were burdensome and negatively impacted the purchase agreement for Ardian. The notice stated that further negotiations were required between Síminn and Ardian, as well as between Ardian and the Competition Authority. Ardian is a fund management company and its representatives have stated that the purchase of Míla is a long-term investment. Ardian representatives have not specified the details of the dispute.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
703,Iceland Review,Imported Premade Sandwiches Sold Cheaper Than Icelandic Equivalents,2022/07/16,"Imported goods and food have long been a standard feature of Icelandic life, but a new product that’s made its way onto the local market is raising the hackles of some who question both its carbon footprint and its price-point. Mbl.is reports that premade sandwiches are now being shipped to Iceland from Lithuania and sold at a cheaper price than their domestically produced equivalents. The imported sandwiches, which are sold under the brand name Food on Foot, caught the attention of Friðrik Árnason, the owner of Hótel Breiðdalsvík in East Iceland. “We import all sorts of things to Iceland, but it never occurred to me that I’d see imported premade sandwiches from Lithuania in a shop in South Iceland,” Friðrik wrote in a post on his Facebook page. “To be honest, I was disappointed to see this, thinking about the environment, carbon footprints, and sustainability. I was even more shocked when I saw that the imported sandwiches are half the price of the sandwiches that are made here, with the same ingredients. It’s a head-scratcher for me.” The sandwiches, which are shipped frozen to Iceland, are imported by the Reykjavík-based company Danól. Managing director María Jóna Samú­els­dótt­ir provided a written response to Mbl after being contacted about the new product and said that the sandwiches are high-quality and have received a good response on the Icelandic market. When asked how a sandwich made in and shipped all the way from Lithuania could be cheaper than a sandwich made in Iceland, María Jóna wrote: “Of course we can’t speak to other parties’ price points, but Danól has a good business relationship with the supplier, which of course, is also producing for a much larger market than the one in Iceland. And as a result, consumers here in Iceland enjoy economies of scale.” María Jóna ended by saying that the primary purchasers of the Lithuanian sandwiches are cafés in rural areas (“often remote villages”) that “see that favorable prices, product quality, and ease of service go hand in hand.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
704,Iceland Review,Smiðjan Brewery First to Sell Directly to Customers,2022/07/15,"Smiðjan Brewery in Vík was the first to sell alcohol directly to customers when it officially got its license on Wednesday, July 13. In a statement to Morgunblaðið, Sveinn Sigurðsson, one of the founders of Smiðjan, stated that it was important for the brewery to finally be able to sell directly. A majority of the customers that visit the brewery are foreign tourists and beer enthusiasts, and now they will be able to take beer home with them more easily. At the moment, Smiðjan just has a restaurant and bar, but they are planning to significantly increase their production to meet the rising demand of direct sales. Smiðjan has been offering brewery tours but expressed frustration that up until now, they were not allowed to sell alcohol directly to their customers after these tours. Smiðjan has also been frustrated that getting their product onto Vínbúðin shelves also takes several weeks, meaning that customers are not getting the freshest product possible. Iceland has, up until now, had a state monopoly on alcohol. All alcohol must be purchased at Vínbúðin, the state alcohol distributor, except for some light beer which is available in grocery stores. Alþingi recently relaxed these restrictions, leading to a boom in online alcohol sales by private retailers.    ","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
705,Iceland Review,"Six Icelandic Firms on Yale’s List of Companies Doing Business in Russia, Three Shouldn’t Be",2022/07/09,"The Yale School of Management names six Icelandic businesses on its list of companies still doing business in Russia, but RÚV reports that three of them have no presence or operations in Russia at all, and one never did in the first place. Attempts have been made to contact the manager of the Yale list, a professor and dean at the university, to make appropriate corrections, but these attempts have not been successful. Failing grades  The list, simply dubbed “Yale CELI List of Companies” (CELI stands for Chief Executive Leadership Institute”) was started on February 28, days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the responses of over 1,200 companies regarding their presence and business activities in Russia have been tracked by Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and the Yale Research Team. “Originally a simple ‘withdraw’ vs. ‘remain’ list,” reads the preface, “our list of companies now consists of five categories—graded on a school-style letter grade scale of A-F for the completeness of withdrawal.” The CELI list is said to be “updated continuously.” As of July 8, 2022, its headline read “Over 1,000 Companies Have Curtailed Operations in Russia—But Some Remain.” As of that time, six Icelandic companies were included on the list. Three of these—Hampiðjan, Knarr Maritime, and Sæplast—were given a grade of F, “Digging In: Defying Demands for Exit or Reduction of Activities.” Two other Icelandic companies—Marel and Naust Marine—were graded D, “Buying Time: Holding Off New Investments/Development” and one, Eimskip, was graded C, “Scaling Back: Reducing Current Operations.” No operations in Russia, but still on the list RÚV contacted the public relations officer for the shipping company Eimskip, who said the company had ceased sailing to Russia right after the invasion and moreover, had not had any operations in the country since 2019, when it closed its Russian office. The PR officer said that Eimskip has attempted to contact Prof. Sonnenfeld to correct its record without success. According to the Yale list, Knarr Maritime, has “members still operating in Russia.” RÚV reports, however, that the company closed its office in Russia two years ago and no longer has any operations there. Sæplast, a company that designs and manufactures insulated tubs and pallets for use in the fishing industry, issued a statement on its website on Thursday, saying that it has no operations in Russia, and never has. “The company has no office in Russia and no employee works there,” reads the statement. “Sæplast sold tubs to Russia for many years, either directly or through agents and/or independent distributors, but since Russia invaded Ukraine, no products have been sold there or delivered from Sæplast to the Russian market. Allegations about Sæplast’s operations and trade with Russia are therefore incorrect.” According to Sæplast general manager Daði Valdimarsson, the company has attempted to convey this information to the managers of the Yale list but has had no success. Sæplast has also been in touch with the Embassy of Ukraine to Iceland (located in Finland) via the Iceland Chamber of Commerce. Still have offices in Russia Naust Marine is one of two Icelandic companies given a D grade, meaning that they’ve paused but not ceased operations in Russia. Four years ago, Naust Marine signed a major deal to sell electric winches to Russia for use on its trawlers. General Manager Bjarni Þór Gunnlaugsson told RÚV the deal is at a complete standstill, but it’s unclear what that means for future operations. Fellow D recipient Marel, a food processing company, published a statement on its website on March 9, saying that it “strongly condemns the military actions of the Russian government in Ukraine” and that it had “taken the decision to pause all new projects in Russia.” The statement continued by saying that Marel has a sales and service operation in Russia, and employees 70 people. It will “continue to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of our employees” and “maintain our dedicated teams in the Ukraine and Russia and our office in Russia, despite expected lower utilization in the near future.” The statement also added that “Marel’s annual revenues and order book in Russia and Ukraine amount to approximately 4% of total.” RÚV was unable to speak to management at fishing manufacturer Hampiðjan, as they were apparently all attending a meeting on Friday. The company has an office in Murmansk, Russia. At time of writing, there was no information on Hampiðjan’s website indicating whether the Murmansk office is still operational, or if the its business activities in Russia have changed at all since the invasion of Ukraine.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
706,Iceland Review,Sharp Rise In Demand and Price of Hotel Accomodation,2022/07/04,"The Statistics Office of Iceland reports that overnight stays in Icelandic hotels have nearly tripled since the same time in the previous year. The primary driver of this increased demand came from the tourism industry, with tourists making up some 79% of overnight stays. The largest increase has been recorded in the capital region. Increased prices have accompanied the increased demand for accommodation. In a recent article in Fréttablaðið, Icelandic traveller Þorsteinn Gunnarsson stated that just a three-night stay in Akureyri would have cost him some ISK 263,000 ($1,974 / €1,888). Þorsteinn claims that these prices raise questions of ethics and greed, and he regrets that Icelanders cannot tour their own country, choosing instead to vacation in Tenerife, for example. Snorri Pétur Eggertson, managing director of Kea Hotel’s sales and marketing division, did not dispute Þorsteinn’s claims but attributed the rise in price to the global pandemic, supply chain shocks, inflation, and increased numbers in tourism. According to the Statistics Office, there were already 558,000 overnight stays in Iceland in May, with more projected for the coming summer months.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
707,Iceland Review,New Collaboration May Make It Possible to Hopp from Bus to E-Scooter in Same Trip,2022/07/03,"A new collaboration between electric scooter company Hopp and the Strætó bus service could make it possible for commuters to easily transfer from bus to scooter using the same app, Vísir reports. When Hopp launched in Reykjavík in 2019, many observers thought it was a death knell for Strætó—that given the option of jumping on an e-scooter, many riders would stop taking the bus entirely. This hasn’t proven to be the case, though. In fact, the two transport modes seem to complement one another, as evidenced by the e-scooters often strewn around city bus shelters. Two modes of transit, one app Hopp was started by software developers and so it only makes sense that they’d be thinking about new ways to integrate their own software and app with Strætó’s. Hopp CEO Sæunn Ósk Unnsteinsdóttir says she believes it should be possible, for instance, for the company’s e-scooters to pop up on the bus map in the Strætó app. “This is, of course, super important, because we know people are starting to pick up the Hopp app to look for scooters when they’re on the bus and coming into the city, for instance,” she explained. Both Hopp and Strætó would also like it to be possible to use the same app to pay for a trip that is split between bus and scooter. The technology exists “Whether it’s a credit with Hopp or [the Strætó app] redirects you to the Hopp app, these are just technical implementations that need to happen when the conversation gets underway,” continued Sæunn. Strætó CEO Jóhannes Rúnarsson agrees. The technology exists, he says, it’s just a matter of kick-starting the process. Other e-scooters have entered the Icelandic market, but Hopp is still the scooter of choice in Reykjavík, and in Iceland more generally. Outside of the capital, the company also has fleets in Akranes, Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, Hveragerði, Reykjanesbær, Selfoss, and the Westman Islands. Abroad, it has e-scooters in three cities in Spain, as well as Norway, Greece, and the Faroe Islands. Hopp records some 6,000 trips a day on its scooters and Sæunn foresees a day where there are e-scooter docks next to every bus station in the city. The company now employs 50 people and is growing its fleet from 1,000 scooters around the capital to 3,000. It is also looking to expand into nearby Árbær and Grafarvogur, as well as a number of other towns in Iceland and abroad (Poland, Hungary, Italy) in the coming year.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
708,Iceland Review,Icelandic Breweries Can Now Sell Directly to Customers,2022/06/30,"Starting tomorrow, July 1, breweries in Iceland will be permitted to sell their alcoholic products directly to customers. The change is thanks to a parliamentary bill passed on June 15 that somewhat relaxes the state monopoly on alcohol sales. While some say it’s high time alcohol was available for sale outside of state-run stores, others are wary increased availability will lead to higher rates of alcoholism. The changes are long overdue, according to Ólafur Stephensen, CEO of the Icelandic Federation of Trade. He told RÚV that he hopes to see legislation concerning alcohol sales relaxed even further. See Also: Business Booming for Online Alcohol Retailers “The goal of the bill was, among other things, to strengthen culture-related tourism around breweries in the countryside. The result is that one or two breweries are excluded, both in Eyjafjörður [North Iceland]. And one producer of spirits in Borgarnes. There is no logic to that,” Ólafur stated, adding that there is no reason producers of spirits shouldn’t also be allowed to sell their products on site. “These are companies that have the same criteria and have been building up tourism around their operations and production. These breweries produce too much and are therefore too big to fall under these legal amendments.” The lack of alcoholic beverages in Icelandic grocery stores catches many foreign tourists by surprise. The state-run liquor store, Vínbúðin, is expensive, and opening hours can be sporadic during holidays and in more rural parts of the country. Vínbúðin stores are always closed on Sundays. While some have argued that increased access to alcohol will lead to increased alcohol abuse, a recent survey shows that almost half of Icelanders want beer and wine to be available in supermarkets.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
709,Iceland Review,Alvotech Completes Dual Icelandic and US listing,2022/06/24,"Biotech company Alvotech became the first dual-listed Icelandic company in Iceland and the US when it completed its listing in Iceland’s stock market yesterday. The company’s founder Róbert Wessman expects a fast growth and that the company will become leading in its field. Biotech company Alvotech’s ordinary shares were admitted to trading on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market in Iceland (“Nasdaq First North”) a week after its debut on the Nasdaq stock market. Róbert Wessman, founder and chair of the Alvotech Board, rang the closing bell at the Nasdaq First North market in Iceland yesterday. In a speech celebrating the occasion, President of Nasdaq Iceland Magnús Harðarson stated that Alvotech was now the second most valuable company in Nasdaq Iceland.

To experience it again here is so great. We’re very excited to list the company in Iceland.” Róbert maintains that Alvotech’s main operations are in Iceland and that they invested over a hundred billion ISK here.

710,Iceland Review,Whaling Restarts in Iceland Following Four-Year Hiatus,2022/06/23,"Two whaling ships owned by the company Hvalur hf. set off from Reykjavík harbour yesterday to begin the whaling season, RÚV reports. No commercial whaling has taken place in Iceland for four years, though a single minke whale was hunted in 2021. The whaling licence held by Hvalur hf. expires next year, and Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries has indicated that the practice of whaling may be discontinued in Iceland afterwards. The whale hunting quota issued by Iceland’s Marine and Freshwater Research Institute for this season is 161 fin whales and 217 minke whales. The quota is based on appraisals from the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission and the International Whaling Commission. According to RÚV, the number of fin whales in Icelandic waters has increased steadily since counting began in 1987. Its conservation status is nevertheless listed as “vulnerable” according to the CITES Appendix. As of 2018, the IUCN Red List places minke whales in the “least concern” category. The whale hunting season lasts from June until late September, and some 150 employees are expected to staff Hvalur hf.’s whaling ships, whaling station in Hvalfjörður, West Iceland, and their processing plant in Hafnarfjörður, in the capital area. Hvalur hf.’s CEO Kristján Loftsson has stated that the main reason for the company’s lack of activity since 2018 is conflict with Iceland’s Food and Veterinary Authority concerning the company’s whaling station. He has also previously cited poor market conditions for whale products and the COVID-19 pandemic as factors. Whaling company Hvalur hf. has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years. Public outcries followed when the company killed a pregnant fin whale and a rare hybrid whale in 2018. Hvalur hf. was at risk of losing their whaling licence after failing to submit captains’ logs for the 2014, 2015, and 2018 seasons. The company has been sued by three of its shareholders as well as by activists. Earlier this year, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated she sees little reason to permit whaling after Hvalur hf.’s current licence expires in 2023. In an op-ed published in Morgunblaðið newspaper, Svandís wrote that there is little evidence that whaling is economically beneficial to Iceland. She also pointed out that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. Svandís stated that the government would carry out an assessment on the potential economic and social impact of whaling this year.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
711,Iceland Review,New Technology for Prawn Fishing Uses Light to Reduce Emissions,2022/06/22,"An Icelandic company has developed a technology for prawn fishing that uses light to herd prawn up from the sea floor. This allows the fishing equipment to remain off the sea floor, leading to less disturbance of the environment and lower emissions than conventional trawling. The technology is set to be put on the market soon. “We are developing the next generation of fishing equipment. Fishing equipment that can fly close to the bottom without touching the bottom. Then we have a light that herds,” Halla Jónsdóttir, founder of Optitog, told RÚV reporters. Optitog has named this patented light beam technology “Virtual Trawl” and has data that shows that it results in higher yields, compared to using the equipment with the light off. “We have a special light that forms a sort of wall or line in the sea and we see that it works to herd [the prawn].” The prawn swims ahead of the light, up off the sea floor and into the nets. It’s possible to set the equipment so that it travels a consistent distance above the sea floor, for example 30 centimetres [11.8 inches]. Because Optitog’s equipment does not trawl along the sea floor, it encounters 30% less resistance than conventional trawling, meaning the method drastically reduces fuel consumption. By leaving the sea floor largely undisturbed, the new technology also reduces CO2 emissions caused by disturbing organic material on the bottom of the ocean. Halla says that a Norwegian party is working to put Optitog on the market as an environmentally-friendly fishing technology. Halla believes the technology could be applied to fishing other species.","Business,Nature,Sci&Tech",1,0,1,0,0,0

Now, following the decision, Hussein and his family are back in Iceland after they were deported to Greece. In a statement from Albert Björn Lúðvíksson, a lawyer at Claudia & Partners law firm, the firm representing the refugee family, the “legal basis for the deportation was not justified.” Additionally, he stated that: “the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board judged their case to have been overdue. This remains unproven, and even if true, it is insignificant, as the Icelandic State stills bears responsibility for the procedure and any delays that have occurred.” Hussein Hussein is a refugee from Iraq who uses a wheelchair. His deportation in November of this year caused widespread outrage when footage surfaced on social media of authorities forcefully removing him from his wheelchair. The incident also caused controversy, as airport authorities attempted to suppress media coverage of the deportations. At the time of the deportation, many expressed concern that Greece lacked facilities and resources for refugees with disabilities. Although Hussein and his family have won their suit against the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Board, it is still possible for state representatives to appeal the case to the Court of Appeals. At this time, state representatives have made no comments with regard to this possibility. Claudia Wilson, the family’s lawyer, has stated that the family arrived in Iceland over the weekend. In statements to RÚV, the family has thanked everyone who has helped them so far in the case. They state that Hussein’s sisters intend to be back in school as soon as possible.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
713,Iceland Review,Continued Cold Spell: Three Pools in South Iceland Closed,2022/12/13,"Three public pools in South Iceland will be closed indefinitely today to save hot water, RÚV reports. Iceland’s national utility company does not expect rationing to affect households. Temperatures around the country are expected to drop further this week. Temperatures in Iceland have barely risen above 0°C over the past days – and the weather is expected to get colder as the week progresses. As noted by RÚV, households in Iceland have been kept warm by an abundance of geothermal energy, and according to information from Veitur – Iceland’s national utility company – the country’s hot-water system is well equipped to handle the cold spell; the system has yet to reach its limit, although Veitur will continue to assess the state of the system on a daily basis. Even though the country’s hot-water supply is expected to handle the coming cold without incident, Rangárveitur, which manages the hot-water supply in three municipalities in South Iceland, is nearing its limit, a press release from Veitur notes. In light of the cold weather, the local authorities have decided to close three public pools in the area – in Hvolsvöllur, Hella, and Laugaland – starting today. The authorities hope that the pools will only be closed for a few days, or over the coldest period. As far as additional reductions to the hot-water supply are concerned, a Veitur spokesperson told RÚV that cuts were always made first among large users – bathing lagoons, public pools, and butcheries, e.g. In the event of forced rationing, Veitur screens for “essential services” while also assessing whether relevant water conduits were capable of withstanding closures. As it stands, there is enough hot water to keep Icelandic households warm, although Veitur could be forced to make brief reductions (as in the case of the public pools in the Rangárvellir municipality). Veitur recommends that homeowners keep their hot-water usage within reasonable limits. Ideally, radiator valves are to be set at 3 (20°C), allowing the thermostatic valve to detect the temperature in the room and adjust accordingly. Windows should be kept closed.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

At a press conference at 14:30 today, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, alongside Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson and Minister of Infrastructure Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, announced the new policies, which aim to support the buying-power of households, while keeping inflation rates down. The child benefit system is to be simplified, while also increasing support for the system, allowing more to qualify for child benefits. The improved child benefits will represent a total increase of ISK 5 billion from the current system over the next two years. Additionally, the system is to be streamlined to reduce the waiting time for child benefits, which are not to exceed four months after the birth of a child. The government also plans to increase the housing supply by incentivizing the development of new real estate throughout the nation. Increased access to social housing will also be a priority, with some ISK 4 billion to be allotted in 2023 to the expansion of affordable housing in Iceland. Housing benefits for tenants will also be increased. Additional reforms include improved pensions for the elderly and disabled, increased funding for workplace training, and reforms to pension funds. Bundled along these concessions to Iceland’s cost-of-living crisis will also be a large increase to police funding. Read the full announcement here.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Also known as the Ukrainian Refugee Center in Iceland, Flottafólk (whose name in Icelandic, Great People, is a pun on the word flóttafólk, which means refugee), “was founded by likeminded volunteers at the start of the war to provide relief for the Ukrainian refugees coming to Iceland,” says Markús. Saturday’s Christmas Ball was the organization’s biggest event of the year and was made possible thanks to volunteers, “both local and Ukrainian, and the goodwill of the local community,” individuals and businesses alike, who donated gifts for the children. 







 The ball treated 400 guests—mostly Ukrainian children and their families—to a delicious holiday banquet including everything from traditional Icelandic Christmas fare such as hangikjöt to pizza, laughs Markús, “for those whose tastebuds are not made for smoked lamb.” 







 After eating their fill, the children got to dance around a giant Christmas tree with some visiting Yule Lads, who then handed out gifts. Members of the Ukrainian community also staged a dance performance. A home away from home “Our hearts are full of pure gratitude to those who have been taking care of us for many months already!” wrote attendee and teacher Tanya Korolenko in the Facebook group “Ísland fyrir Úkraínu” (‘Iceland for Ukraine’). “The spirit of Christmas is everywhere now. It’s beautiful…And all Ukrainians here, in Reykjavik, are thanking you heartily for allowing us to feel it, to enjoy it ourselves! It means a lot!” 







 “Thanks to Flottafolk and its keen volunteers Ukrainians get a HOME to meet every Tuesday, they have plenty of help with practical issues like clothes and hygiene,” continued Tanya. “But what touches me the most is when people take care of other people’s feelings. Like you did today.” Indeed, Flottafólk has been providing relief to the Ukrainian refugee community in Iceland since the beginning of the war, Markús explains. “Relief has been in the form of food, clothing, jobs, events and field trips for kids, educational programs, psychological support, childcare and basically everything necessary. This winter our biggest focus has been on the distribution of clothes and necessities,” he continues, noting that these distributions take place twice a week at Neskirkja and the community centre in the Grandi neighbourhood on the west side of Reykjavík. “During the open houses we often get visits from local educators and speakers or do something special like concerts, and traditional gingerbread-making and decoration.” Plans to expand in the New Year Invigorated as the volunteers are by their joyful celebration on Saturday, Flottafólk has even bigger plans for the new year, says Markús. “We would like to expand the educational programs, including various art workshops, but need more space as the community centre we have access to has its own extensive programming.” 







 “One of the things we have planned for the new year is a writing workshop for kids,” says Markús, which would be co-taught by himself and Tanya Korolenko. “This would hopefully culminate in a bilingual book with the children’s writing and illustrated by Ukrainian artists.” It seems clear that Flottafólk and its ongoing, collaborative efforts have helped to create a strong sense of kinship between local volunteers and members of the newly arrived Ukrainian community, something that Markús Már is quick to affirm. “I had no connections to Ukraine before the war, but as a volunteer and now, project manager for the community centre and educational programs, I feel strong kinship with the Ukrainian people. The refugee community has shown great gratitude to all of us volunteers and given back in so many ways.” Photos by Alesia Kovalova (Алеся Ковальова)",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
718,Iceland Review,Incident Involving Refugee and Son Ejected from Bus Sparks Outrage,2022/12/11,"An account of a refugee and his son being prevented from boarding a Strætó bus from Reykjavík to Keflavík on Friday evening has invoked a public outcry and garnered a great deal of attention, both on social media and from community leaders, Vísir reports. Nichole Leigh Mosty, director of the Multicultural Information Centre, says the story isn’t surprising, and that cultural sensitivity training is important for people in service jobs who deal with diverse populations. Refused to let another passenger pay fare According to a public Facebook post published by Joana Diminiczak, a man and his young son boarded a Strætó 55 bus at the University of Iceland stop at 6:31 PM on Friday. The man attempted to use the payment card provided for him by the municipality of Reykjanesbær, but the card didn’t work. The driver told him he had to pay his fare out of pocket and began to berate him in front of the other passengers. The man called someone and handed the phone to the driver, who said that “‘these refugees’ never want to pay,” wrote Joana in her post, “they bring useless cards and he’s not a charity, he does his job, and wants to finally go home and have his dinner.” Joana continued, saying that the driver then turned to the man and said in English, “I live in Njarðvík [one of the towns that comprises Reykjanesbær]. I’ll find you.” At this point, Joana said she attempted to intercede and pay the fare for the man and child, but the bus driver refused, saying he had called the police. “I ask him to call the police [back] and say the matter is resolved because I will pay for them, but he didn’t want to do it. When I say that I can call so he doesn’t have to, he still doesn’t want to let me pay!!! The man gives up, takes his son, and they get out. He looks up at the sky, near tears, but still with hope in his eyes of sparing the boy the humiliation, and says, ‘He watches us.’ We pull out and the bus driver proudly calls the police and says that he is no longer in need of assistance.” Joana then concluded her post, writing, “Such drivers shouldn’t be driving buses. I hope that Strætó takes this matter seriously.” At time of writing, the post had received 202 largely sympathetic and outraged comments, many of which called on Strætó to address the situation. It had been also been shared around 1,400 times. ‘They need training in how to deal with this diverse group of customers’ When contacted for comment, Nichole Leigh Mosty, director of the Multicultural Information Centre, said the story did not surprise her. “I wasn’t surprised, because I know there have been difficulties implementing the Klappið app [Strætó’s payment app]. It isn’t designed for diverse members of society, for foreigners or senior citizens. And we’ve seen this behaviour from employees over and over. It’s a stressful job, but the fact that they are serving a diverse community means that they need training in how to deal with this diverse group of customers. But don’t make such prejudicial statements and [provide] poor service.” Nichole says that cultural sensitivity training is vital. “Whenever we have people in a service position, cultural sensitivity is needed considering that there are all sorts of people who use public transportation. And those who are serving them need to be able to treat everyone who uses that service with respect.” ‘It’s very clear that we’ll be looking into what went on there’ Strætó’s director Jóhannes Svavar Rúnarsson told reporters that he wasn’t familiar with the situation himself, but that the case has been referred to the Icelandic Road Administration, which services bus lines that run outside of the capital area. However, at time of writing, Bergþóra Kristinsdóttir, manager of the Road Administration’s service department, said that she was not familiar with the situation either. “It’s not a nice story. It’s not come across our desk, I’ve not received any other information about this incident. But it’s very clear that we’ll be looking into what went on there,” said Bergþóra.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

720,Iceland Review,"Couple Who Are Blind Twice Denied Entry Onto Flight, Told to Pay for Escort",2022/12/10,"An Icelandic husband and wife who are blind were twice prevented from boarding an SAS flight to Iceland after being told that they needed to pay for an escort to accompany them onboard. RÚV reports that the couple, who were traveling with their one-year-old daughter at the time, will be pursuing legal action against the airline. Eyþór Kamban Þrastarson and Emilía Pykarinou had a flight booked from Athens, Greece to Copenhagen, Denmark, and then on to Iceland. However, when they tried to board the Scandinavian Airlines flight, they were denied entry. “The airline insisted that we be accompanied by another person,” explained Eyþór, who said that the couple was also supposed to pay for a third seat for this purpose. They tried to board another flight two days later but were prevented from boarding for the same reason. Eyþór believes that the fact that he and his wife were traveling with their young daughter played a part in the airline’s reluctance to allow them to board, but insisted that they’d have never booked the flight if they didn’t feel comfortable looking after their child while flying. In the end, the Eyþór and Emilía were only able to board because, a week after they were supposed to have traveled home, they found an Icelandic woman who already had a ticket for the same flight and who agreed to act as their escort. The couple intends to pursue legal action with both Blindrafélagið, the Icelandic Association of the Visually Impaired, and the Icelandic consul in Greece, supporting their case. “This is by no means over,” said Eyþór, pointing out that the airline’s policy allows for children as young as five to travel unescorted. “We are in no way okay with the fact that we were ordered to find someone to fly with us, let alone pay for it.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
721,Iceland Review,Terror Suspect’s Defence Attorney “Astonished” by “Vague” Charges,2022/12/09,"Earlier today at the District Court of Reykjavík, formal charges were brought against two men suspected of planning a domestic-terror attack. A defence attorney for one of the suspects has told Vísir that he is “astonished” by the charges. As reported earlier today, the District Prosecutor filed a motion for extended custody over two men suspected of planning a domestic terror attack earlier this year. The court approved the motion, and custody was extended for an additional four weeks. Formal charges were also brought against the two suspects. One of the suspects was charged with an act of attempted terrorism and weapons offences. The other suspected was charged as an accomplice to an act of attempted terrorism, weapons offences, and a minor narcotics violation. Speaking to Vísir today, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, defence attorney for one of the suspects, stated that he was “astonished” by the charges: “They’re charged with unspecified offences against an unspecified group of people at an unspecified time between May and September. It’s as hairy as a chimpanzee’s back.” According to Sveinn Andri, the police authorities had been too extreme in their initial operations. “The only attempted offence, in this case, was an attempt to destroy the lives of two young men,” Sveinn Andri observed. “The charges are founded on weapons that they had hoarded. My client was not in possession of any weapons. There’s a reference to weapon production. These are probably the first terrorists who hoard weapons but then sell them before committing an act of terrorism, which must constitute a highly questionable for of preparation,” Sveinn Andri remarked. Sveinn Andri added that he and his client would have to “roll with the punches.” They would begin by examining a motion for dismissal, given the vague nature of the charges. “It’s complete nonsense. Terrible. You’ve completely upended the lives of these two young men on the basis of ego. The police jumped the gun in the beginning and everything that they’ve done since has been geared toward justifying that initial jump.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
722,Iceland Review,Charges to Be Brought Against Domestic-Terror Plot Suspects,2022/12/09,"The District Prosecutor will push for continued custody over two men suspected of planning a domestic terror attack earlier this year. Formal charges are expected to be brought against the men at the District Court of Reykjavík today. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. Speaking to RÚV today, district attorney Karl Ingi Vilbergsson stated that the District Prosecutor has decided to charge the two suspects for violating Article No. 100 of Iceland’s General Penal Code. The charges are expected to be introduced when prosecutors motion for extended custody over the two men at the District Court of Reykjavík today. RÚV notes that this is likely the first time that such a charge is brought in Iceland. In an interview with Mbl.is, however, Karl Ingi stated that the District Prosecutor had “never considered” charging the suspects on the basis of Article No. 100 of Iceland’s General Penal Code. He was not willing to offer further detail on the content of the charges at this time. As previously noted, the two suspects arrested in September had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had also discussed carrying out attacks against various political figures, among them Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and Chairman of Efling, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir. Article 100 of Iceland’s Penal Code: [Art. 100 a [Punishment of up to lifelong imprisonment shall be imposed on any person committing one or more of the following acts of terrorism with the intention of causing the public serious fear or unlawfully compelling the Icelandic or foreign authorities, or international institutions, to take action or refrain from taking action with a view to weakening or damaging the constitutional structure or the political, economic or social basis of the state or international institution:]1) Article 20 of the General Penal Code states that for “an attempted offence, a more lenient punishment may be imposed than for a completed offence.” This article will be updated.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
723,Iceland Review,Hot Water Shortage in Selfoss: Public Pool Closed Indefinitely,2022/12/09,"A fire in an electrical box of the Selfossveitur utility company has led to a hot-water shortage in Selfoss. The Árborg municipality has encouraged residents to save water and the public swimming pool in Selfoss has been closed indefinitely. As noted in a press release from the Árborg municipality yesterday, an electrical box in one of the boreholes of the Selfossveitur utility company caught fire on the night before Thursday, December 8. The fire forced a reduction in energy production, leading to a shortage of hot water.   Selfossveitur subsequently activated its contingency plan, with residents of the Árborg municipality being encouraged to use their hot water sparingly. The municipality’s website offers advice to residents on how best to save water, including ensuring that windows and front doors remain closed and making sure that radiators are not blocked by long curtains or furniture. In light of the shortages, Sundhöll Selfoss, the public swimming pool in the town of Selfoss, has been indefinitely closed. “Which is why we’ve decided to close the Selfoss public swimming pool indefinitely. We will let you know immediately when we have a more detailed timeline regarding when we’ll open again,” a press release from the Selfoss swimming pool on Facebook reads.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
724,Iceland Review,The Icelandic Medical Journal Publishes Report on Fireworks-Related Injuries,2022/12/08,"Using data gathered between 2010 and 2022, the Medical Journal of Iceland has released a report on fireworks-related injuries in Iceland. The study searched through medical records between these years for reports of fireworks and information related to the circumstances and severity of the injuries. In total, some 248 people were sent to the hospital during this time for fireworks-related injuries, ranging in age from only 9 months old to 79 years old. A large proportion of injuries, 39%, were also found to have been caused by faulty fireworks. Rockets were found to be the most dangerous, accounting for 23% of all injuries, followed by multishot box fireworks, which accounted for 17% of all injuries. Injuries to hands and eyes were most common, and across the period of the study, individuals were hospitalized for a combined total of 91 days due to their injuries. The report concludes that “firework accidents are a significant problem in Iceland.” An average of 21 Icelanders end up in the emergency room every year due to fireworks-related accidents. The large majority of these accidents occur on New Year’s Eve and the first hours of the New Year. Fireworks-related accidents also, perhaps unsurprisingly, show a strong gender bias, with some three out of four affected individuals being male. However, a more serious trend is the number of children affected, with just less than half of all injuries coming from minors. One preschool-aged child, on average, each year ends up in the emergency room, generally due to a lack of supervision. Over the course of the entire study, most injuries were found to be relatively minor cuts and burns, but at least 13 people were identified as having suffered serious injuries. The study suggests an increased emphasis on the correct handling of fireworks, especially the use of safety glasses. Given the relatively high frequency of fireworks-related injuries, the study also suggests “considering further restrictions on their import, sale, and use.” The report can be read in its entirety here.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

726,Iceland Review,"New Crime Bill Includes Upwards of 1 Billion ISK in Funding, Increased Police Powers",2022/12/07,"Following Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson’s declaration of a “war on organised crime” after the recent knife attacks in a Reykjavík nightclub, Icelandic police are set to receive ISK 500 million (3.5 million USD, 3.3 million EUR) in funding for the establishment of special investigation teams. In an interview with RÚV, the minister stated: “It is absolutely necessary to take drastic measures to stop the development that is taking place in Icelandic society when it comes to organised crime.” Included in the new crime bill is the ability for Icelandic police to now monitor individuals, not under concrete suspicion of having committed a crime, but merely for connections to known criminals. The police will now also be able to monitor places known to be associated with organised crime, in addition to writing “preventative search warrants.” Such warrants will lower the standard for probable cause, allowing Icelandic police to issue search warrants on suspicion of criminal activity. According to the budget proposals for the new crime legislation which was submitted to parliament this week, ISK 500 million are expected to go to Icelandic police to strengthen their response to organised crime. Much of the new funding is expected to go to the establishment of special investigation teams against organised crime. The budget committee has also proposed an additional ISK 750 million (5,3 million USD, 5 million EUR) to address “weaknesses in police operations” throughout the country. Of these new funds, ISK 650 million are to be allocated to general operations and training, with another ISK 50 million each going to equipment and investigations. The budget committee stated that the new funds aim to “improve the quality of investigations, shortening case turnover, improving operations in rural areas, and improving equipment in the fields of digital and technical investigations.”  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
727,Iceland Review,Pornographic Film Created in Ambulance Under Investigation,2022/12/07,"A pornographic film is under investigation for having been recorded in an Icelandic ambulance, reports Fréttablaðið. Authorities state they are taking the matter seriously and that an investigation into the matter has begun. According to Fréttablaðið, the capital region fire department was alerted to the existence of the video via a confidential tip. The incident is significant as the sale and production of pornography are illegal in Iceland. The incident also raises concerns over security, and how the individuals responsible for the pornographic film were able to gain access to the ambulance in question. The film in question features a woman posing as a patient and a man as an emergency medical technician. Sources report that after an internal investigation, it was concluded that although the ambulance in question is indeed Icelandic, it was not operated by the capital area fire department. Authorities have concluded that the ambulance is either from another municipality, or else an older vehicle that has been sold to a private individual. The incident was an occasion for some moral outrage, with some condemning the use of a vehicle used to treat the sick and dying for such purposes. Despite the outrage, however, there is no indication that the ambulance is currently in service. Spokesperson for the capital area fire department, Ásdís Gíslason, stated: “The issue is being taken very seriously, and we regret having been involved in this matter.” Update: Video Likely Filmed at Skógarhlið in Reykjavík According to the latest information, the ambulance in question was located in the fire department facility in Skógarhlið. Since the matter has been reported in the media, authorities have received numerous tips. Now, they state that several clues from the video indicate that it was indeed recorded at a fire department building in Reykjavík. Birgir Finnsson, assistant fire chief in the capital area, stated that there are no security cameras at Skógarhlið, as it had not previously been considered necessary. When asked if other individuals had access to the facility, he stated that although “the building is of course just for use by the fire department, there is something going on that we’re looking into.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

A prayer service was held for the man in Grindavík on Sunday. The search continues for a fisherman who fell overboard just outside Faxaflói Bay on Friday afternoon. The man, a Grindavík resident and father of three, was a fisherman on the longline fishing boat Sighvatur GK-57, which is owned and operated by the Grindavík-based fishing company Vísir hf.

RÚV reports that the search and rescue operation is the most extensive of its kind in years, with eight ships and one of the Coast Guard’s helicopters currently taking part. Ships went out in search of the man as soon as the Coast Guard got word of his accident at around 5:00 pm on Friday. At the time, two helicopters, the Coast Guard’s patrol ship Þór, and 14 fishing vessels and search and rescue boats joined the search. The majority of the search was paused just before 1:00 am on Saturday morning, although the patrol ship Þór continued to look overnight. The search resumed in full at 10:00 am on Sunday morning; one of the Coast Guard’s helicopters joined in around 11:00 am. Given the time that had passed since the sailor fell overboard, the search area was expanded to a radius of ten nautical miles to the northwest of the Garðskagi peninsula. Guðmundur Birkir Agnarsson, the Coast Guard’s operations manager, said that search conditions on Sunday were worse than they were the day before, with stronger winds and waves, and more limited visibility. At time of writing, the sea temperature in Faxaflói Bay was about 5°C [41°F]. Accidents at sea have, thankfully, become far less common than they used to be in Iceland. “Over the last few years, we haven’t had any fatal accidents at sea, including with people falling overboard,” said Guðmundur Birkir. “So this probably the most extensive search we’ve had in recent years.” Search and rescue efforts will continue until darkness falls, Guðmundur Birkir confirmed, although he did not say how efforts would continue if the missing man had not been found by then.

731,Iceland Review,Former Minister Jón Baldvin Sentenced in Sexual Harassment Case,2022/12/03,"Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson, former government minister and diplomat, has received a suspended sentence of two months’ imprisonment in a sexual harassment case related to an incident that took place at his home in Granada, Spain in 2018, Vísir reports. The Landsréttur Court of Appeals also ordered him to pay all court and appeal costs related to the case. Jón Baldvin’s defense attorney has said that an application will be made to the Supreme Court requesting the right to appeal the judgement. An acquittal The sexual harassment charges were first brought against Jón Baldvin in 2019, when Carmen Jóhannsdóttir accused him of having groped her buttocks during a dinner party in Granada the year before. Resolution on the case was long delayed, however, in part because the Reykjavík District Court repeatedly dismissed it because the incident took place in Spain and was therefore not, the court contended, under its jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals overturned this dismissal on technical grounds: over four weeks had passed between the oral presentation of the call to stop the case and the court’s decision to throw the case out. As such, the District Court was forced to reopen the case. Competing witness testimony also came into play. Carmen’s mother, Laufey Ósk Arnorsdóttir, was also in attendance at the party in 2018 and testified that she witnessed Jón Baldvin groping her daughter. The District Court rejected Laufey’s testimony, saying it did not correspond to Carmen’s version of events. Instead, it accepted the testimony of Jón Baldvin’s wife Bryndís Schram and a neighbor, who corroborated his version of events. The Reykjavík District Court finally ruled on the case in August 2021 and Jón Baldvin was acquitted of the charges. A conviction The case was then taken up again by the Court of Appeals, with the District Attorney seeking a suspended sentence of two to three months for Jón Baldvin. Carmen Jóhannsdóttir also sought damages totaling ISK one million [$7,086; €6,725]. Carmen’s claim for damages was rejected, but the Court of Appeals granted the DA’s suspended sentence of two months. In its decision, the Court of Appeals stated that Carmen’s account of the incident was credible, and was, in fact, supported by that of her mother. It was the Court’s opinion that these testimonies outweighed Jón Baldvin’s denial. A long history of accusations  Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson was an MP for the Social Democratic Party, serving as Minister of Finance from 1987 to 1988 and Foreign Affairs Minister from 1988 to 1995. Following his time in parliament, he served as a diplomat, first to the US and Mexico from 1998 to 2002, and then to the Baltics from 2002 to 2005. He has faced repeated accusations of sexual harassment and impropriety throughout his career, dating all the way back to 1967 when he was a teacher at an elementary school. In 2012, it was revealed that Jón Baldvin had sent his wife’s niece Guðrún Harðardóttir sexually explicit letters starting when she was 14 years old. Jón Baldvin denied that he sexually harassed Guðrún, but apologised for what he called a “lapse of judgement” in initiating the correspondence. Guðrún attempted to press charges against Jón Baldvin, but police dropped the case. See Also: Former Minister Accused of Sexual Harassment Over 50-Year Period In 2013, Jón Baldvin was invited to be a guest lecturer at the University of Iceland. When objections ensued, the university withdrew the invitation. Jón Baldvin protested the decision and threatened to take legal action, upon which the university agreed to pay him ISK 500,000 [$3,542; €3,361] in compensation and publicly apologised for how they handled the matter. In 2019, Stundin published interviews with four women, including Carmen Jóhannsdóttir, in which each described incidents of sexual harassment by Jón Baldvin. A Facebook group called #metoo Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson was formed around the same time, and at least 12 women used the platform to share accounts of sexual harassment at the hands of the former politician. In the face of all these incidents, however, Jón Baldvin has maintained his utmost innocence. He called Carmen’s charge “pure fabrication” and stated it was part of “a coordinated attack on my reputation.” ‘It hasn’t been an easy journey, but today, it all became worth it’ Carmen was abroad at the time that the Court of Appeals published its decision, but she spoke to reporters after she’d had some time to process the news. “This is very much a cause for celebration,” she said. “I know it’s not a heavy sentence, but it’s just the fact that he’s been sentenced at all. I didn’t expect it, to be perfectly honest, but I’m really happy about it.” “It’s been a long process and of course, there’s already been one ruling on it. But I have to say that I’m really happy about this. I’m happy about this victory—not just for me, but also for everyone who’s been subjected to abuse at the hands of Jón Baldvin.” “Hopefully, this will set a precedent for other judges and lawyers,” continued Carmen. “And also just for people who haven’t had the desire or ability to claim their rights—that it’s worth it, even if it’s hard. I’ll absolutely admit that it hasn’t been an easy journey, but today, it all became worth it.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Ísafjörður, located in Iceland’s Westfjords, is a town of roughly 3,000 residents. Next summer, tourists – numbering ten times the town’s population – are expected to arrive in Ísafjörður via cruise ships. A total of 218 ships, carrying 245,000 passengers (excluding crew members) have announced their arrival. During a 35-day period next summer, RÚV notes, 3,000 visitors are expected to arrive in Ísafjörður every day. “8,200 tourists are expected to arrive in town during one particular day.” In an interview with RÚV published this morning, Arna Lára Jónsdóttir, Mayor of Ísafjörður, added the caveat that experience had shown that there were always a few cancellations. “Nonetheless, this is a record number of arrivals, which will greatly test our infrastructure. That much is clear.” As noted in RÚV’s article, the port dues paid by cruise ships have become the main source of income for Ísafjörður harbour, which also comprises the harbours of Þingeyri, Flateyri, and Suðureyri. (The Ísafjarðarbær municipality was founded in 1996 with the merger of six municipalities in the northern Westfjords: the districts of Þingeyri, Mýri, Mosvellir, Flateyri, Suðureyri, and Ísafjörður). By directing traffic through these four harbours, the municipality would be able to ease the burden. “Those passengers that arrive here, go all the way to Arnarfjörður, to Dynjandi, or here into Djúpið. So we’re able to distribute the burden, so to speak,” Arna Lára observed, noting that the numerous arrivals presented an opportunity for the travel industry – although it was important not to overdo it. “There are many residents who monitor arrivals at the harbour; they may decide to avoid the downtown area completely in the event that there are four or five cruise ships arriving.” Arna Lára added that Ísafjörður was a fishing town and that the fishing industry needed its space: “We’ve got to strike a balance. But there are many days in Ísafjörður where we’re completely booked.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
733,Iceland Review,First Female Pilot in Iceland Retires After 38 Years of Flight,2022/12/01,"Sigríður Einarsdóttir landed today for the last time at Keflavík International Airport. Sigríður Einarsdóttir was the first female commercial airline pilot in Iceland. Her 38-year career paved the way for many other women in Icelandic aviation. Her Boeing 757, designated Vatnajökull, her favourite plane to pilot according to Vísir, touched down early in the morning yesterday. Passengers reported an “exceptionally smooth” landing. She was greeted by a reception of other female Icelandair pilots who celebrated her long, pioneering career in aviation. Sigríður’s career began in 1984 aboard a Fokker F27 turboprop, and three years later, on the airline’s new jets. In 1996, she became a full captain. At her reception, Sigríður stated: “I don’t think that it’s really sunk in yet that this was the final landing. It was only on the final approach that I really realized that this had been my last flight, on a jet at least.” Although she’s retiring, she has no intention to stop flying: “I don’t think I’m done. It’s just so much fun to fly. Now I just need to go renew my private license and get back into smaller planes.” After her 1984 start, Sigríður recalls that she was the only female pilot for the first five years of her career. “After ten years, there were three of us,” she said. “After twenty years, the tenth woman was hired.” Now, she says, there are some 77 altogether. Despite the progress made by Sigríður, aviation is still largely a male industry in Iceland, with 13% of Icelandic pilots being women. “This isn’t a man’s job anymore,” she said in her farewell address. “We’ve shown and proved this.”  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
734,Iceland Review,Police Concludes Investigation Into Domestic Terror Plot,2022/11/30,"The police authorities have concluded their investigation into two men suspected of plotting a domestic terror plot, Vísir reports. The district attorney’s office will decide whether or not to bring charges against the two suspects over the coming days. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody for the past ten weeks and will remain in custody until next week, at least. Speaking to Vísir earlier today, District Attorney Ólafur Þór Hauksson stated that the police authorities had investigated whether the two men were, on the one hand, guilty of violating the General Penal Code on terrorism and, on the other hand, guilty of perpetrating firearms offences. It is not clear at this time whether the two men will be indicted and, if so, when. According to Ólafur, a decision will be made before long. Last week, a judge extended custody over the two suspects for two weeks; they had already been held in custody for nine weeks. One of the suspects’ lawyers appealed the decision last week, but the Court of Appeals confirmed the decision, Ólafur stated. No decision has been made on whether or not a petition for extended custody will be filed. As noted in Vísir’s article, the two men are not the only individuals connected to the case that will possibly be charged with weapons offences. As noted in a police press conference in September, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had reportedly discussed targeting various political figures. They had also discussed carrying out an attack during the police’s annual celebration.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
735,Iceland Review,Hope that Efling Contract Will be Accepted,2022/11/29,"Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir, chairperson of Efling trade union, has expressed her optimism that wage negotiations with SA, the Federation of Icelandic Employers, may be reaching an acceptable conclusion. The most recent round of contract negotiations has been complicated by changes in ASÍ (The Confederation of Icelandic Labour) leadership and rising interest rates in the face of high inflation. Normally negotiated for longer terms, a shorter-term contract has been suggested as a stopgap to help what has been a difficult negotiation process. Efling has now agreed to make an offer to SA that will include an ISK 56,700 annual raise (USD EUR), in addition to other cost-of-living allowances. The contract as offered will be valid until January 31, 2024. Cost of living has been a pressing issue in the recent renegotiations, and Efling’s current offer represents a much more humble demand than some of their previous suggestions. However, a statement by the union highlights that the current offer represents what would have been the gains in the first year of a normal three-year contract: “In the opinion of the negotiating committee of Efling, the agreed increases need to protect the households of low- and middle-income earners from the effects of inflation and guarantee them a fair share in economic growth and the profits of the company. […] The bargaining committee of Efling believes that other unions have made a mistake by agreeing to percentage increases in negotiations with SA. There have been proposals for discussion where high-income groups are expected to benefit twice as much as low-wage earners.” Here, Efling refers to a debate within trade unions on whether to go to the bargaining table with demands for flat wage increases, or percentage-based wage increases. Percentage-based wage increases favour higher earners, and such demands have been a cornerstone of BHM’s demands (The Icelandic Confederation of University Graduates). However, for lower wage earners, flat increases to wage generally tend to increase buying power more directly. Efling submitted their offer to SA yesterday. Previously, they had submitted similar terms, but SA rejected them on grounds of the length of the contract. Now, Efling is hoping that the new, shorter contract will be accepted. In a statement, Sólveig Anna said: “We will see how this shapes up. I’m not ready to say that we’ve reached the finish line. I know it’s a complicated game we’re playing […] I think it’s likely that we need to do something more, but the message to us was clear and meaningful.”  ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
736,Iceland Review,Dismissed for Distributing Video of Stabbing,2022/11/29,"The individual responsible for distributing video footage of the recent knife attacks in a downtown Reykjavík nightclub has been relieved from their post, reports RÚV. Ólafur Þór Hauksson, district prosecutor, confirmed this in a statement to RÚV, and stated that it is not believed the employee in question intended for the video to be distributed so widely. However, since its release one week ago, the video has been shared extensively across social media. The video in question showed footage from the security cameras in the downtown Reykjavík club as a group of masked men entered the building and stabbed three individuals. At the time of the leak, there was concern that the leak of the video could potentially hurt the investigation of the case. Now, Reykjavík police have concluded their investigation of the matter and consider the case closed. After the leak, police officer Grímur Grímsson stated that “the video appears to have been recorded with a phone from the computer screen, and it appears to be a police workstation. I think we can say that this has never happened before, that information on an ongoing investigation has been leaked in this way.” Presumably, the police were able to trace the workstation back to the relevant employee and conclude the investigation. Several people are reported to have been questioned on the video and its distribution. No further information on the responsible individual has been provided, except that they were an employee of the police force. As of Friday, their employment is reported to have been terminated.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
737,Iceland Review,New Recycling Sorting in Reykjavík Next Year,2022/11/28,"Starting next year, Icelandic households will have four bins to sort recycling into. The changes come in light of new regulations in waste management, which include a restructuring of the collection of waste disposal fees, and a coordinated waste management system for the entire capital region. One of the biggest changes for the average household, however, is that it will now be required for Icelandic households to properly recycle organic waste. A new bin is being introduced, which will be for organic material. Reykjavík households will also need to use biodegradable paper bags for their organic waste instead of plastic. However, households will be receiving a year’s worth of paper bags. Biodegradable plastic bags have not been found by SORPA to degrade fast enough to be used. Paper and plastic recycling bins will also disappear from communal locations, as these will now be picked up at all households. It has not yet been decided to what extent households will share in the costs of the new system, though it will certainly require some changes. Households will need to have all four bins, but it has been stated that it may be possible for households to use two-part bins, which separate between plastic and paper, for instance.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
738,Iceland Review,Too Many Unhoused People Must Rely on Reykjavík’s Parking Garages for Shelter,2022/11/28,"Harm reduction expert Svala Jóhannesdóttir stated recently in an interview with RÚV that too many unhoused people in the Reykjavík area are forced to rely on parking garages for shelter. The situation, according to Svala, shows a lack of resources for the homeless in Reykjavík. According to recent statements by experts at the Healthcare Centre for the Capital Area, parking garages have become injection sites for many of Reykjavík’s unhoused people. One parking garage in particular, by Vesturgata, has been singled out as particularly problematic because it is near a children’s daycare and also housing for the elderly. A guard was recently hired in the parking garage following an incident where a health centre employee was assaulted in the parking garage. Although many unhoused people have access to some form of shelter, many have no place to go during the day. Unhoused men, in fact, are forced to leave their shelters during the day, a requirement that has led to protests as winter approaches. “This is a natural manifestation of the lack of options which is the rule for so many unhoused people in the capital area,” stated Svala to RÚV. Svala has worked advocating for unhoused people with addiction problems for some 15 years and is one of the founders of Matthildur, an association for harm reduction in Iceland. She also stated: “There has been a large increase in the number of people who are looking for space in the city’s emergency shelters. The emergency shelters close at 10AM and then open at 5PM. For these seven hours, people have no place to go.  We’ve found that for these seven hours, people are simply not in a good place.” In order to better support people with addiction problems, Svala has called for resources that are available during the day as well. The number of unhoused people has risen significantly in the last years in the capital area, with increased housing prices, drug problems, and other factors driving the trend. The capital region is also the only municipality in Iceland that provides services to the unhoused, meaning an increased burden for social services in Reykjavík.  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
739,Iceland Review,"Women, Life, Freedom: Candlelight March in Solidarity with Activists in Iran and Afghanistan",2022/11/28,"UN Women in Iceland hosted a candlelight march against gender-based violence on Friday night. RÚV reports that this is the first time the march has been held since the COVID-19 pandemic began and took place under the slogan “Women, Life, Freedom,” echoing the rallying cry that has taken up by feminist activists and protestors in Iran and beyond. The march began at Arnarhóll and ended at Bríetartorg, a small square in downtown Reykjavík that commemorates activist and suffragette Bríet Bjarnhéðinsdóttir (1856 – 1940). Harpa concert hall was illuminated in orange during the event, as orange has come to symbolize a better, violence-free future for women and girls around the world. 







 According to a Facebook post about the event, the candlelight march marks the beginning of 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence, “an international campaign that commences on 25 November—the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women—and ends on 10 December, Human Rights Day.” This year, the 16 Days of Activism campaign continues with its ongoing mission to end femicide, “the murder of women  because they are women.” Event organizers say that 81,000 women and girls were killed globally in 2020, around 47,000 or 58% of whom died at the hands of an intimate partner or a family member. This equates to a woman or girl being killed every 11 minutes in their home. “By taking part in UN Women Iceland’s Candlelight March,” concluded UN Women in Iceland, “we show solidarity with the brave women and girls of Afghanistan and Iran who are leading the fight against their countries’ regimes’ repressive treatment of women and girls, while being met with brutal and often lethal force.” ‘There’s no going back because there’s nothing to go back to’ Friday’s march was led by activist Zahra Mesbah, an Afghan woman who was born in Iran, Iranian Zoreh Aria, and UN Women in Iceland director Stella Samúelsdóttir. Individuals from both Afghanistan and Iran were invited to walk in front. In her speech, Zahra emphasized unity, saying: “The only thing that matters is that I am a person, and all people deserve freedom and to live with dignity.” 







 For her part, Zoreh urged attendees to show their support for the Iranian women who are risking their lives every time they protest. “In their minds, there’s only one way forward and there’s no going back because there’s nothing to go back to,” she said. “They are fighting for freedom and dignity. We ask people to stand with peace, freedom, and the Iranian nation and to ask the government to take action.” All photos taken by Heiðrún Fivelstad on behalf of UN Women in Iceland.

The unfortunate kitty was taken to a veterinary hospital and underwent surgery that same day. Diego has a home and owners, but on most days can be found lolling about atop the printer paper in the stationary store A4, padding through the Hagkaup department store, or even dropping in for a slice at Domino’s. In a country of dedicated cat lovers, Diego has been said to be Iceland’s most famous cat. Fans are known to make special trips to Skeifan just to try and spot Diego and a Facebook group in his honor has over 9,500 members. According to a post on the group on Friday, Diego suffered torn muscles and ligaments in the accident, as well as a bag wound on one leg. He underwent surgery and was to be kept in the animal hospital overnight. Shortly after news of his accident went public, A4 started collecting donations to help pay for Diego’s medical bills. A total of ISK 400,000 [$2,838; €2,725] was collected for Diego’s owners, with A4 and Domino’s both donating ISK 100,000 each [$709; €681]. This article was updated.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
741,Iceland Review,Twenty-Four People Connected to Downtown Knife Attack Released from Custody,2022/11/26,"Police have released twenty-four people who were being held in connection with the knife attack in downtown Reykjavík last weekend, RÚV reports. Six individuals remain in custody. A knife attack at the Bankastræti Club nightclub in Reykjavík last weekend left three young men hospitalised, following which, there was a spate of retaliatory crime against the suspects’ families. Petrol bombs were thrown into family members’ homes, windows were broken, and the suspects’ families were also subjected to harassment. Three people have now been arrested for throwing the petrol and smoke bombs. See Also: Heightened Police Presence in Reykjavík This Weekend DS Margeir Sveinsson noted that despite the fact that police have released two dozen people connected with the incident, these individuals are still legally considered defendants in the case. “But there’s no need or reason to keep them in custody any longer,” he said. “We’ve managed to determine what happened there and what everyone’s part was. Next step is to process all the data we have, that is, phone data etc. to get a handle on the lead-up [to the event]. But we don’t need to keep people in jail to do that.” There was initially some fear that the wave of retaliatory crimes would continue, but there was no additional incident on Thursday night, which Margeir said he hoped was a good sign. “Let’s hope that people will come to their senses and quit this nonsense and that things will calm down a bit.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
742,Iceland Review,Heightened Police Presence in Reykjavík This Weekend,2022/11/25,"Partygoers in downtown Reykjavík this weekend can expect an increased presence among police authorities. The Capital Area’s Assistant Chief of Police has told RÚV that the police will “be ready” in the event of retaliatory violence following last weekend’s knife attack. Following mass arrests in wake of a knife attack at the Bankastræti Club nightclub in Reykjavík last weekend, which left three young men hospitalised, petrol bombs were thrown into houses, windows broken, and the suspects’ families were subjected to harassment. There were also posts on social media, encouraging retaliation for the attacks. The American and British embassies in Iceland subsequently issued travel advisories to tourists, warning them to avoid large crowds downtown this weekend. Addressing these issues on the radio programme Morgunútvarpið this morning, Ásgeir Þór Ásgeirsson, Assistant Chief of Police for the Capital Area Police, stated that the police would command a much greater presence in downtown Reykjavík this weekend, in the event that further acts of violence were to be perpetrated. “As far as we’ve gathered, there were, and are, threats of violence this weekend – and the operations of certain Reykjavík restaurants are expected to be disturbed,” Ásgeir stated. “We’re going to protect our city this weekend – as we’ve always done.” When asked if individuals connected to the gang violence last weekend were expected to perpetrate further violence, Ásgeir replied that he hoped not. “But law enforcement isn’t predicated on hope. We have to be ready when we say that we’ll be ready and we’ll be ready this weekend.” Ásgeir was unwilling to offer details on the exact meaning of “an increased presence” among police authorities but stated that they would mobilise more equipment and more officers capable of handling “difficult assignments.” This heightened police presence would not be lost on anyone. “It’s absolutely clear that the people will feel our presence. We hope that the people involved in these altercations have come to their senses and won’t be dragging their disputes to downtown Reykjavík. I think that that’s something all of us, collectively, have been aiming towards,” Ásgeir stated.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
743,Iceland Review,"Prison Guards to Receive Stab-Resistant Vests, Possibly Tasers",2022/11/25,"The Minister of Justice will answer the call from prison guards regarding increased training and protective equipment, Mbl.is reports. The Director General of Prison and Probation Administration notes a worrying trend of violence and weapons use within Icelandic prisons. As noted in an article published on Mbl.is yesterday morning, violence and weapons use among Icelandic prisoners have greatly increased over the past years. In light of this trend, prison guards have called for better protective equipment, stab-resistant vests, and, in some instances, access to tasers. Páll Winkel, Director General of Prison and Probation Administration, told Mbl.is that the prison system was facing a “new reality,” with weapons now being confiscated from cells and common areas on a regular basis. “This was almost unheard of, a couple of years ago. It’s my responsibility, first and foremost, to ensure the safety of my employees. We’re not enthusiastic about carrying weapons within our prisons, but we obviously need to reassess our protocols. And we may need to reconsider how we interact with certain groups of inmates, i.e. those who create and carry makeshift weapons,” Páll stated, adding that these weapons were improvised from shards of plexiglass, saw-blades, screwdrivers, screws, and nails. Speaking to Vísir.is yesterday, prison guard Sigurður Rúnar Hafliðason stated that he’d experienced these trends first-hand: “We’ve got this much tougher, more violent core of prisoners, who are also abusing drugs to a greater extent. And so there’s a big difference in how we’re managing prisoners today, compared to when I was starting.” As noted by the article, three serious assaults have been perpetrated against prison guards this year. According to Sigurður, the younger generation of prisoners commonly carries knives and post-traumatic stress has increased among prison guards. Sigurður Rúnar doesn’t necessarily believe that tasers are necessary, arguing that stab-resistant vests and improved training is vital. “We need to improve safety … we need training so that people feel safe while they’re at work.” Mass arrests and budgetary constraints have also put pressure on an already strained system. In an article published in Morgunblaðið this morning, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated that the safety of prison guards and police officers was “a priority.” “What’s happening inside prison walls reflects broader trends within our society,” Jón remarked. “I’ve had extensive conversations with the prison authorities, and it’s clear that we must respond on many different levels.” According to Jón, this response will, among other things, include stab-resistant vests. The Ministry is also considering equipping prison guards with tasers. “We’ve repeatedly witnessed serious incidents within the country’s prisons. It’s clear that it’s necessary to equip our people in such a way that their safety is ensured at their places of employment. And we do that by providing better protective equipment. Additionally, we need to consider structural organisation; we can’t allow things to develop in such a manner within our prisons.” Physical altercations involving knives have been in the news lately, with a knife attack at the Bankastræti Club nightclub last weekend and a fifteen-year old boy being stabbed in the Garfarvogur neighbourhood of Reykjavík earlier this week.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
744,Iceland Review,Number of Apartments Sold in Capital Area Hits Two-Year Low,2022/11/25,"331 apartments were sold in the capital area in October, a 22% decline compared to the previous month. The number of apartments sold in the capital area has hit a two-year low, Fréttablaðið reports. This week, the Central Bank announced that it was raising key interest rates by an additional 0.25%. Short-term interest rates (seven-day term deposits) would thereby reach 6%. The increase, which serve to complicate wage negotiations, came in response to a month-on-month rise in inflation, which rose from 9.3% in September to 9.4% in October. In an interview with Fréttablaðið, Ýmir Örn Finnbogason, an analyst at Deloitte, explained that rising interest rates had led to a cooling real-estate market; an update to Deloitte’s real-estate dashboard, based on statistics from Registers Iceland, showed a 22% decline in the sale of apartments in the capital area in October when compared to September. As noted by Deloitte’s report, even though sales have declined, prices have remained almost unchanged between the months: the average price of a square metre for an apartment was ISK 709,000 ($5,000 / €4,800) October, ISK 2,000 ($14 / in €14) higher than in September. “Rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have an obvious effect,” Ýmir Örn told Fréttablaðið. Ýmir expects the real-estate market to continue cooling over the coming months, in light of growing tensions in the economy and wage negotiations. As noted by Deloitte, single-family homes and apartments have followed the same trend, with fewer properties being sold in both categories: the number of single-family homes sold in October compared to September declined by 16%. The average price of a square metre also declined from ISK 647,000 ($4,600 / €4,400) to ISK 624,000 ($4,400 / €4,300). “Real-estate prices reflect consumers’ investment power, which is primarily affected by the cost of borrowing money, i.e. interest rates. And rising interest rates obviously lead to a cooling market,” Ýmir Örn stated. As noted by Fréttablaðið, the price of apartments and multi-family homes have risen in North and East Iceland but fallen in South and West Iceland.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
745,Iceland Review,Bus Scanners Rendered Unusable,2022/11/24,"Strætó has missed payments on its ticketing system, Klapp, leaving the QR code scanners unusable and in need of replacement. Kjartan Magnússon, city representative for the Independence Party, has stated that the situation has led to excessive costs for Strætó, which it is not in a position to handle. Serious mistakes have been made in the adoption and implementation of the new payment system, he said. Strætó has now had to postpone payment of its bills due to a lack of funds. According to Kjartan, at an annual meeting of municipal associations, Sorpa, and the Capital Area Fire Department, it came to light that Strætó, Iceland’s public transportation system, is barely operational. Where annual projections forecast an operational deficit of ISK 93 million, Strætó has actually operated at an ISK 1.1 billion loss just in the first nine months of 2022. The gap between projected and actual losses is significant, and Strætó’s equity has subsequently seen a decrease of ISK 22 million. Kjartan is quoted in Morgunblaðið as stating: “For a whole year, passengers have received the answer that it was just a growing pain, which would soon be a thing of the past. At the meeting, however, it was stated that the scanners used in the buses would be unusable and the only solution would be to replace them all and buy new ones.” This will represent significant further costs to an already-struggling transportation system.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Jóhannesson raised the target goal of Ramp Up Iceland at a press event for the organisation this Monday, November 21, from 1,000 new ramps to 1,500. The president “heckled” Ramp Up founder Haraldur Þorleifsson, interrupting his presentation by spray-painting over the poster with his new, more ambitious goal.  Ramp Up Iceland is an initiative which aims to increase accessibility to people in wheelchairs throughout Iceland. Ramp Up coordinates between businesses, contractors, and state and city authorities to make applying for permits and grants easier. Ramp Up originally had a goal of 1,000 handicap-accessible ramps in Iceland by 2026, but this goal has now been raised to 1,500. As we were celebrating the first 300 ramps, @PresidentISL heckled my speech and announced we are raising our @rampur goal from 1000 to 1500 ramps across all of Iceland.And since he's the president I guess we have to do it. pic.twitter.com/XkcDjsssrB Haraldur Þorleifsson, a Twitter employee, is notable as one of Iceland’s highest taxpayers. The founder of the Ramp Up initiative, he has used his income from the sale of his company Ueno to Twitter to fund this philanthropic project, among other things. Haraldur is also noteworthy as an outspoken proponent of Iceland’s social system, choosing to pay income instead of capital gains tax on the Ueno sale, citing the many advantages he has received through his Icelandic education and healthcare. The Ramp Up press event took place in Mjódd, a bus station, in celebration of the 300th ramp built under the initiative. During the event, the president asked if 1,000 ramps would be enough, and interrupted Haraldur to spraypaint over his previous goal. In response, Haraldur stated: “Guðni is of course the president, so when he says something, we have to listen.” He continued: “We all live in a community together, and when people need help, then we all have a responsibility to help out. I am just happy to be able to contribute.” Many businesses and public places throughout Iceland remain inaccessible to people in wheelchairs, especially older buildings.

748,Iceland Review,"A Third of Icelanders Read Books Every Day, Study Finds",2022/11/22,"Icelanders read or listen to an average of 2.4 books a month, according to a new survey conducted by the Icelandic Literature Centre. The survey notes an increase in the number of individuals who read five or more books a month and those who report not reading at all. According to a new survey conducted by the Icelandic Literature Centre – which has been conducted annually since 2017 – the percentage of individuals who “never read” has increased (from 32.1% last year to 40.4% this year). However, so has the percentage of individuals who read five or more books a month. The survey, which was conducted between October 14 and November 8 of this year, comprised 1,409 respondents (out of 2,800). The survey also found that over a third of Icelanders read or listen to books on a daily basis. The average number of books read per month has risen over the past two years; last year, Icelanders read an average of 2.3 books a month, compared to 2.4 books this year. 65% of respondents stated that they only or mainly read books published in the Icelandic language, which is up from 58% compared to last year. The survey also found significant differences between the genders. According to the results, women read an average of 3 books a month compared to 1.7 among men. The gap between the genders has slightly narrowed between the last two years, however. Here are a few other takeaways from the survey: When it comes to the Icelanders’ taste in reading, most prefer novels, or 59%. Crime fiction was the second most popular genre among respondents. Over a half of respondents, 55%, stated that they received book recommendations from friends and relatives; 35% stated they were influenced by coverage from traditional media; and 31% from social media. Over the past 12 months, just over a third of Icelanders have borrowed books from libraries. The survey found that women borrow books from the library more frequently than men and parents with two or more children at home borrow books from the library most frequently. The results also indicate that fewer people are giving books as gifts when compared to last year. The survey was conducted by the Icelandic Literature Centre in collaboration with the Reykjavík Library, the Association of Icelandic Book Publishers, Hagþenki, the University Library, Reykjavík UNESCO Literary City, and the Writers’ Association of Iceland.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
749,Iceland Review,Mass Arrests Put Pressure on Already-Strained Prison System,2022/11/22,"Iceland’s prison system is operating at near maximum capacity. Three times as many individuals are being kept in police custody than usual, the Director General of Prison and Probation Administration has stated. The police arrested 27 people following a knife attack at the Bankastræti Club in Reykjavík last Thursday. Twelve suspects have been kept in custody, with the police having yet to decide whether they will request custody over five additional suspects. Four other individuals connected to the attack remain on the lam, some of whom are believed to have fled the country. Páll Winkel, the Director General of Prison and Probation Administration, told Mbl.is that a total of 60 people are currently being held in police custody – three times the usual number. Aside from the many arrests made in relation to the Bankastræti Club attack, there have also been numerous arrests made in connection with drug busts and violent crimes. “It does, of course, put tremendous pressure on the system,” Páll observed, “detaining 15 prisoners in isolation. It calls for greater manpower and organisation; you need to safeguard investigative interests, that the prisoners don’t meet, while, at the same time, ensuring that their rights are being respected.” “These are people aged 19 and up. These are Icelanders and foreigners, men and women, non-disabled and disabled persons, including one individual who’s blind.” Most of the prisoners are being detained in the Hólmsheiði prison, although some have been transferred to Litla-Hraun. According to Páll, the design of Hólmsheiði has proven advantageous, as there are spaces equally suited to regular confinement and isolation. Páll predicts that the situation will remain unchanged for a few more days but hopes that that will be the extent of it. “It puts tremendous strain on the system. Also because it happens to coincide with our effort to temporarily decrease the number of prisoners so as to operate within budget constraints.” Speaking to RÚV, Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated that the government had already taken steps to deal with the pressure on the prison system, with extensive renovations at the Litla-Hraun prison expected to be completed next year. According to Jón Gunnarsson, there have been instances where prison sentences lapse owing to a lack of cells. “We must respond, and we are doing our best,” he stated, admitting that increasing the number of prison cells would take time and that bridging the gap could prove tricky. “We’re not quite sure how; this additional pressure means additional operational costs, and we’ve even been in the position where we’ve been unable to fully use all of the prison cells because of budgetary constraints … we’re working on it.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
750,Iceland Review,Minister of Justice to Declare War on Organised Crime,2022/11/21,"Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson has announced his intention to wage war against organised crime following the knife attacks in a Reykjavík club last week, which have been taken as signs of gang warfare. On Thursday night, November 17, a group of masked and armed men stormed a Reykjavík nightclub, stabbing three men, who were since transported to the ER. Of the nearly 30 men involved in the attack, already some 14 have been apprehended by the police. Two are suspected to have fled the country, with the police now searching for the remaining suspects. According to Minister Jón Gunnarsson, the incident reveals a problem with organised crime in a nation generally upheld for its security. In response to the minister’s call for a “war on crime,” efforts are now being prepared to attack the root causes of organised criminality in Iceland. The Minister has also expressed his desire to strengthen police powers, with what Jón Gunnarsson calls “preventative warrants,” allowing for “proactive investigation.” Such measures have been controversial in Alþingi, but Jón Gunnarsson has stated that his proposals would be “harmless.” Such warrants would allow police to monitor individuals associated with known criminals and criminal activity, without themselves being found guilty of any crime. The proposed measures would also add tasers to the police arsenal. Currently, Icelandic police officers only carry batons and pepper spray in the field. In a statement to Vísir, the Minister said: “The steps we take may prove to be controversial, I have no doubt about that. Both of these new authorisations, for preventative warrants and weapons for the police, may be controversial, but we have to do it.”  ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
751,Iceland Review,"Reykjavík Commits to Accepting 1,500 Refugees Next Year",2022/11/21,"The City of Reykjavík has signed a resolution, committing the city to accept 1,500 refugees next year. Under the leadership of Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson and Minister of Social Affairs Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, the city has announced its hope that other municipalities make similar plans in cooperation with the state as soon as possible. Such agreements between the state and municipalities were drafted earlier this fall concerning levels of state funding for the municipalities that will be accepting refugees. The funding was outlined in order for the municipalities to be better able to estimate the number of refugees they will be able to accept. Minister of Social Affairs Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson is quoted in Vísir as saying: “We are in conversation with quite a few local authorities. I just want to encourage the municipalities, whatever their size, to get involved in this as well. I think that the kind of precedent that is being created by the country’s largest municipality getting involved now is very positive.” The City of Reykjavík had previously committed to accepting 500 refugees. The new level represents a threefold increase over the previous figure. Despite the significant increase, Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson has stressed that this number is only half of what Iceland has so far received this year. “This number is much higher than previously,” stated Dagur to Vísir. “Unfortunately, I think we have to assume that the War in Ukraine will not be resolved anytime soon and that this will be an ongoing project for some time.” A pressing concern is to find housing for the incoming refugees. The capital region already faces difficulty in providing affordable housing, although recent initiatives have sought to incentivize further development.  “This is of course a challenge,” stated Dagur. “There’s no point in hiding that. But the city has been in agreement since the first days of the invasion that we condemn the invasion of Ukraine, and we have shown ourselves ready to work together with both the state and other municipalities in order to accept these refugees.”  ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
752,Iceland Review,Petrol Bombs and Threats of Retaliation Following Knife Attack in Downtown Club,2022/11/20,"Reykjavík and capital-area police are investigating a series of crimes believed to be connected to the knife attack that occurred at Bankastræti Club in downtown Reykjavík on Thursday night. RÚV reports that in the wake of the attack, which left three young men hospitalized, petrol bombs have been thrown into houses, windows broken, and suspects’ families subjected to harassment. There have also been posts on social media, encouraging retaliation for the attacks. Police believe that the incidents possibly herald the beginnings of a gang war, although this but one possible explanation. Police still searching for over ten suspects; two have fled the country A group of almost thirty people, all dressed in dark clothing and masks, barged into Bankastræti Club on Thursday night and attacked three men, all of whom were in their twenties, stabbing them repeatedly before fleeing the scene. The stabbing victims have since posted on social media, seemingly unruffled by the incident, and two of them were also interviewed on FM957 on Saturday. In the interview, they said that one of them had been stabbed a total of seven times, but was feeling pretty good, all things considered, or “like a king,” as he put it. As of Saturday, fourteen of those involved in the attack had been arrested and nine had been sentenced to two weeks in police custody. Police were still searching for over ten of the remaining suspects, although their identities were believed to be known. Two suspects have fled the country. Over the weekend, police called for anyone involved in the incident to come forward, but only one person did. A search of suspects’ phone data is also underway, but police say this will be an extensive and intensive process. Stress on prison system The scope of the incident and the number of people remanded into custody is already straining the local prison system’s capacity, as it is unusual for so many people to be held at once. Halldór Valur Pálsson, director of the Icelandic prison system, says that while prison officials in no way anticipated an incident of this scope and with this many detainees, Icelandic prisons still have enough capacity to deal with the situation at present. But things could become serious, he says, if a gang war is, in fact, underway. “It absolutely threatens the safety of the staff and other prisoners as well, if this kind of conflict is going on,” he said. “If there are gang conflicts happening out in society, they also find their ways into the prisons in the end.” The capacity issue is not just a question of being able to hold suspects while the police investigate, however. It also has a knock-on effect for those waiting to serve a prison sentence. New measures have been introduced in recent years that allow convicted individuals to serve their sentences outside of prison walls, for instance by means of electronic surveillance or community service. But there is still a waiting list for those who are actually required to serve their sentences in prison. These individuals must wait to serve their sentences until a facility has room for them. There are currently 317 individuals waiting to serve their prison sentences. Stabbing may be linked to motorcycle fire Police say that the investigation is progressing well, considering its scope. The inciting incident has yet to be confirmed, but it’s possible that the stabbings were related to two motorcycles that were set on fire in Álftamýri on the east side of Reykjavík last Wednesday night.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
753,Iceland Review,Fatality in Bus and Scooter Collision,2022/11/20,"A man on an electric scooter died this weekend after colliding with a bus, RÚV reports. The victim, who was a foreign national living in Iceland, was in his twenties. This is the second fatal accident involving an electric scooter in Iceland. The first occurred almost a year ago exactly, in November of 2021, when a man in his 50s collided with a motorcycle. According to police spokesperson Guðmundur Páll Jónsson, the man seems to have driven his scooter into the side of a group coach about the size of a bus, when it was travelling at low speed. The collision took place at the corner of Barónstígur and Grettisgata around 9:00 pm on Saturday night. Police are still investigating the circumstances of the accident. The The Red Cross offered trauma support and counseling to seventeen of the passengers, as well as three more witnesses on Sunday. Sunday also happened to be a day of memorial for victims of traffic accidents. Eight people have died in traffic-related accidents in Iceland in 2022. This article has been updated.

Three men in their early twenties, all of whom had suffered knife wounds, were transported to the ER. A group of men barged into the nightclub Bankstræti Club in downtown Reykjavík last night. The group, reportedly dressed in dark clothes, attacked three other men (all of whom are about twenty years old) before absconding from the club. The police were notified at just after 11.30 PM and arrived on the scene quickly, RÚV reports. The police immediately began searching for the assailants, who are believed to have been inside the club briefly. Dozens of police officers were involved in the investigation and a few search warrants have already been executed.

755,Iceland Review,"Hot-Water Supply Nearing Limit, Rationing to be Considered",2022/11/18,"The nation’s hot-water supply is nearing its limit, Vísir reports. Utility companies may need to begin rationing hot water during long periods of cold weather, a specialist at Samorka has stated. Samorka, a federation of energy and utility companies in Iceland, held an open meeting at the Harpa Conference Hall yesterday. During the meeting, specialists assessed the hot-water supply of the largest utility companies and reviewed forecasts of future demand. In an interview with Vísir, Lovísa Árnadóttir, Samorka’s public relations officer, stated that the situation at the nation’s utility companies was serious: hot-water use has outpaced population growth. Utility companies are stretched to the limit trying to meet the current demand – not to mention the growing demand in the future. The demand in the capital area is expected to increase by 3% annually. “If we peer further into the future, to the year 2060, for example, forecasts suggest that the output of the entire heating system would need to be doubled. In terms of relative size: the Hellisheiði Power Station, which provides hot water for most of Reykjavík, is approximately twice the size of the Kárahnjúka Power Station. And so we’re talking about a lot of energy, and doubling the output is no small task,” Lovísa told Vísir. Approximately 60% of the energy used in Iceland comprises hot water for domestic heating, baths, and other household consumption. This amounts to 43 terawatt hours (a unit of energy equal to outputting one trillion watts for one hour), or twice the amount of energy produced by all of the nation’s electric power stations. “The current production areas are already operating at maximum capacity, and so we need to look for ways to make them more efficient. We could do this by, for example, encouraging individuals to use their hot water more frugally,” Lovísa remarked. This could be accomplished by encouraging individuals to take brief showers instead of baths and by managing sidewalk heating during the summer. Utility companies all over Iceland are considering their next steps. “The problem is that geothermal exploration takes a long time, which is part of the problem why we’re struggling to meet demand right now: because increased demand has exceeded forecasts and geothermal exploration can take a decade. Familiarising ourselves with new geothermal systems also takes time.” Speaking in layman’s terms, Almar Barja, a specialist at Samorka, stated that utility companies may need to ration hot water, possibly to households, businesses, and service providers – in the event of long periods of cold weather this winter or the next. According to Almar, it is not clear how the problem is to be solved, at least in the short term, an article in Vísir notes. Almar also noted that consumption patterns were changing, with individuals opting for roomier homes, more people choosing to live alone, and families shrinking. All of this means that an increasingly greater number of square metres need to be heated. Almar added that Samorka was also not seeing frugal use among consumers nor the expected contraction in hot-water use following directives on the insulation of houses, the improved insulation of new houses, e.g. by floor heating.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
756,Iceland Review,150 Cattle Taken by Authorities in Abuse Case,2022/11/17,"150 cattle have been removed from a farm in Borgarfjörður by the authorities on November 14 and 15. After repeated demands by authorities that their owner improve their conditions, authorities have finally been forced to confiscate the cattle after it became clear the farmer in question would not cooperate. Both police officers and representatives from MAST, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, were at the scene, reports RÚV. The owner in question is said to have a long history of mistreating his animals. Sheep and horses have been previously taken from the farmer to be slaughtered, as they were too maltreated to be rescued. Some cattle confiscated in the latest episode will likewise be slaughtered, but many of the cows will be allowed to live and given new homes. Ellen Ruth Ingimundsdóttir, district veterinarian for Southwest Iceland, stated that such cases are very difficult for all involved: “It’s a long and difficult story. We decided that it was no longer possible to give deadlines that weren’t met […] We don’t take animals from people just because we want to. We need to follow the law and we need to do this in consultation with locals so that it doesn’t hurt the animals. That’s why it has also taken a long time.” Ellen additionally thanked those farmers who will be receiving the remaining cows, which are headed to barns with better pasture and conditions.  ","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
757,Iceland Review,A Third of Icelanders Read Daily,2022/11/17,"A new report from the Icelandic Literature Center has shed new and interesting light on the reading habits of Icelanders. The annual study has been carried out since 2017. On average, Icelanders listen to 2.4 books per month, with 32% of the nation reading at least once a day. However, Icelandic readership is undergoing a notable shift, with both the groups of those who never read and those who “binge read” growing. The study also reported a marked difference between the genders, with women reading significantly more than men. The gender gap also correlates with a gap in education, with the college-educated generally reading more than those with a secondary level of education. Older people were found to read on average more than younger people, with the youngest group polled, those between 18 and 24, reading the least out of all groups. In a comparison between the capital region and Iceland’s countryside, no significant difference was recorded. Some 65% of Icelanders read either exclusively or mostly in Icelandic. This represents a slight change from last year, when the figure sat at 58%. 18% of those polled read equally in Icelandic and another language, with another 14% of residents reading more often in another language than Icelandic. Finally, 3% of those polled read exclusively in another language. The language difference also breaks down along age, with those 34 and younger generally reading in other languages more often than the older groups polled. Usage of public library resources was also recorded, with women again using the library more often than men. Among the top users of public libraries were households with two or more children. The report, which can be read in full here, was authored in cooperation with the Reykjavík City Library, Association of Icelandic Publishers, Hagþenkir, the National and University Library of Iceland, Reykjavík UNSECO City of Literature, and the Writers’ Union of Iceland.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
758,Iceland Review,Dramatic Helicopter Maneuvering Saves Life,2022/11/16,"An Icelandic coast guard helicopter likely saved a man’s life last Friday when it flew backwards for five kilometres to Ísafjörður. The dramatic manoeuvre was needed because of weather conditions in Ísafjörður, and doctors at the National Hospital of Iceland say that the helicopter crew’s decisive action likely saved the man’s life. This story was first reported by Vísir. Conditions were extreme in Ísafjörður when the call for help came to Iceland’s coast guard last Friday, with wind ranging between 35 to 40 m/s, and little to no visibility. Andri Jóhannesson, helicopter pilot in the coast guard, stated that the mission was one of the most difficult he had been a part of in his 15-year career. Andri stated to Vísir that when the crew arrived in the Westfjords, wind conditions were so bad that it was not possible to fly straight into Ísafjörður like usual. With a strong north-northwest wind, it would have been extremely dangerous to fly into the fjord, but nevertheless, the crew tried twice to fly into the fjord at a low altitude. However, the zero-visibility conditions made this impossible. After these failed attempts, the crew was forced to make a roadside landing in order to assess the situation further. When the crew took stock of the situation, it was clear that they were running low on fuel. The crew had flown in a stiff headwind all the way from Reykjavík, and the multiple attempts at entering the fjord had forced them to spend more time in the air than they had planned. The crew would not be able to make it to Bolungarvík, a village near Ísafjörur, and the location of the patient. The crew would be forced to land in Ísafjörður to refuel and pick up the patient there. Given the conditions, the crew realised they would not be able to fly the usual way, with the wind at their back, as it would be impossible to turn the helicopter to land in Ísafjörður. The decision was made to instead fly with “their nose in the wind,” that is, backwards, for a total of five kilometres. This, however, was not the end of the drama. Given the low visibility, flight mechanic Árni Freyr had to lead the way. With the back of the helicopter open, Árni directed the final approach of the helicopter. In a harness and partially hanging out of the helicopter, Árni led the crew like this for some 20 minutes. Upon landing in Ísafjörður and taking on the patient, the helicopter was forced to perform a “hot refuelling,” in which the engine stays on. Given the harsh winds, it may have been impossible to start the rotors again if the engine was turned off during the refuelling process. The patient, who had suffered a heart attack, was immediately sent into surgery upon arrival in Reykjavík, and doctors claim he would have died without the crew’s bravery. The story, dramatic as it is, highlights the critical role played by emergency services in Iceland. Many remote parts of Iceland become largely inaccessible during the winter. Often, there is only one rescue helicopter on call, and there have been calls to increase funding to the coast guard and search and rescue services.    ",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
759,Iceland Review,Esports Manager Among Suspects of Iceland’s Biggest Cocaine Bust,2022/11/15,"None of the four individuals arrested during the biggest cocaine bust in Icelandic history has a criminal record, Vísir reports. A lumber dealer and a former eSports team manager are among the suspects that were arrested this summer. The case will be filed in court tomorrow. In August of this year, the police confiscated 100 kg of cocaine, which had been hidden inside seven logs included within a timber shipment to Iceland. The drugs were planted inside the logs in Brazil before being shipped to Iceland via the Netherlands. As reported by Vísir, the Icelandic police got wind of the shipment in connection to an investigation into organised crime and subsequently notified police authorities in Rotterdam. The Rotterdam police replaced the cocaine with a fake substance before the container was shipped to Iceland. The estimated street value of the drugs is ISK 2 billion ($14 million / €13 million). The indictment states that the container was shipped from customs to Borgartún in Reykjavík where it stood unmoved for two days. The container was then transported to Hafnarfjörður, where the cocaine were removed, packaged, and delivered to a third party for distribution and sale. The police subsequently seized the cocaine inside a vehicle on Vefarastræti in Mosfellsbær. The suspects have been charged with engaging in organised criminal activity, attempted large-scale narcotics offences, and money laundering. The case will be filed in the Reykjavík District Court tomorrow.  As noted by Vísir, none of the suspects possesses a criminal record of note. One of the defendants is a timber dealer in his sixties, whose company, Hús og Harðviður, was used to launder money. The other suspects are in their twenties and thirties, and include a former team manager of Iceland’s eFootball national team. The district attorney has motioned for several items, believed to have been purchased with ill-gotten gains, to be seized: including a Rolex watch, a Lexus, almost 100 logs of timber, a Volkswagen jeep (believed to have been purchased for the transportation of drugs), and a number of smartphones, among other things. During a raid on the suspects’ homes, the police found quantities of drugs, including MDMA, marijuana, and cannabis. Cash deposits that could not be accounted for All of the four suspects are charged with money laundering and are believed to have, for some time leading up to the arrests on August 4, received, stored, converted, or gained from profits resulting from criminal offences. The police believe that millions of Icelandic króna were stored in the suspects’ bank accounts, for which they could not account. In most instances, the money was traced to cash deposits. As reported by Vísir, the defendants are expected to receive lengthy sentences. Recently, two men received 12-year sentences – the maximum punishment for such crimes – for extensive drug offences, having imported narcotics to Iceland via a salt spreader.  According to Chief Superintendent Grímur Grímsson, the recent cocaine busts may have led to an increase in drug-trafficking through Keflavík Airport, which have been on the rise over the past weeks and months.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
760,Iceland Review,Enrollment in Opioid-Substitution Treatment on the Rise,2022/11/15,"Individuals receiving opioid-substitution treatment have significantly increased over the past years. According to Minister of Health Willum Þór Þórsson, 276 people were enrolled in the treatment in 2019, compared to 438 in 2021. Following a formal enquiry by MP Diljá Mist Einarsdóttir – on whether doctors would be granted greater authority to prescribe opioids to those struggling with addiction – Minister of Health Willum Þór Þórsson gave no indication before Parliament that greater authority would be granted. Read more: In Harm’s Way: Opioid Addiction in the Age of Harm Reduction Willum Þór explained that opioid-substitution treatment is provided primarily by three institutions in Iceland: SÁÁ (the National Centre of Addiction Medicine), the University Hospital of Iceland (Landspítalinn), and the Akureyri Hospital in North Iceland. The main drug employed during treatment in Iceland is Buprenorphine, both in tablet and injectable form, which is a licensed drug (“costly and/or must be treated with care”) administered at no cost to patients and supervised by the University Hospital’s Medicines Advisory Board. The use of Buprenorphine in injectable form, Willum noted, is restricted to healthcare institutions (H-label) while Buprenorphine in tablet form must be prescribed by doctors with knowledge and experience of addiction (Z-label). This means that physicians specialising in addiction treatment, who have secured a license and can demonstrate experience, outnumber psychiatrists when it comes to the prescription of Buprenorphine. Willum also noted that Buprenorphine is primarily administered to patients at Vogur’s MAT (medication-assisted treatment) clinic in Reykjavík (in accordance with an agreement regarding opioid substitution treatment signed by Icelandic Health Insurance and SÁÁ) although a number of patients retrieve their drugs in tablet-form at pharmacies. As noted by the National Library of Medicine, opioid-substitution therapy (OST) is an “evidence-based intervention” for opiate-dependent individuals, which replaces “illicit drug use with medically prescribed, orally administered opiates such as buprenorphine and methadone.” As noted in the Minister’s response before Parliament, individuals receiving opioid-substitution treatment (OST) have “increased significantly over the past years.” According to the minister, 276 people were enrolled in the treatment in 2019, compared to 438 in 2021. SÁÁ’s medication-assisted treatment (MAT) clinic at the Vogur treatment centre has gradually expanded over the years and as of late summer treats 250 patients – most of whom have injected opioids or have suffered serious consequences as a result of their addiction. According to Dr Valgerður Rúnarsdóttir, the Medical Director of SÁÁ, MAT patients receive methadone, buprenorphine pills, or injections, which reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opioids. “There’s a low threshold for participation,” Valgerður stated. ‘We’d be seeing a much higher overdose rate if it weren’t for this programme. We also collaborate with other healthcare and social services to help people become sober. If we want to improve the lives of these people, these factors must be entwined.” Although most of the patients in Vogur’s MAT are either sober or aspiring toward abstinence, there are also some who are not ready to quit. It is important to provide services to these individuals, and the City of Reykjavík, according to Valgerður, has greatly improved access to housing for this group of people over the past years. “Things are much better today compared to ten years ago,” she stated, adding that besides offering treatment and other services, removing stigma is also vital.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
761,Iceland Review,Results of 2021 Census Reveal Changes in Icelandic Society,2022/11/14,"Statistics Iceland has recently published new data from the 2021 census, revealing a growing nation and shifting demographics. Here, we break down some of the major takeaways. The full report can be found here. As of January 1, 2022, Iceland is home to some 359,122 residents. This represents a 13.8% increase from the last census, taken in 2011. Statistics Iceland reports a discrepancy of some 10,000 inhabitants with the records of Registers Iceland. This population growth is distributed very unevenly across Iceland. Suðurnes, the region of the Reykjanes peninsula outside of the capital area, has grown by some 28%, with South Iceland following at 19%, and the capital region at 15%. The slowest growers have been Northwest Iceland, at 0.6%, and the Westfjords, at 1.6%. However, these numbers are not entirely telling the full story. Although no region has experienced a population decline on average, the countryside is still decreasing in residents. In West Iceland, for instance, when the town of Akranes in included, the region saw overall growth. But when Akranes is not accounted for, the region as a whole decreased in population considerably. On average, Iceland has 3.5 inhabitants per square kilometre. Iceland, like many other Western nations, is also an ageing nation. In 2011, the proportion of the population 67 and older was 11%, but this figure now stands at 13%. The gender balance has also shifted slightly since the last census. In 2011, some 49.9% of Icelanders identified as women, but according to the latest figures, that figure now rests at 49%.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

763,Iceland Review,"Report on Íslandsbanki Sale Highlights Lack of Transparency, Reliance on Outside Consultants",2022/11/14,"State regulators have released a report on the controversial sale of Íslandsbanki shares that took place this March. Among the considerations of the report are details on the dissemination of information of the sale, the determination of its sale price, and the selection process for determining the qualified investors. After the 2008 banking collapse, the insolvent banks were restructured, leading to the partial socialisation of Iceland’s three major banks, Landsbankinn, Arion, and Íslandsbanki. Landsbankinn continues to be held by the state with a majority share. However, Íslandsbanki has been gradually privatized since the restructuring, with an initial 35% of Íslandsbanki shares being sold in June 2021. After a sharp rise in share prices after the sale, some claimed that the shares were undervalued. In March 2022, a second round of sales was slated, with 22.5% of Íslandsbanki shares to be sold off. This second offering, however, was not a public offering like the first, but was limited to a group of “qualified investors.” Among the qualified investors were the usual suspects, including foreign and domestic investors, and pension funds. However, the list also included some notable individuals such as Benedikt Sveinsson, father of Bjarni Benediktsson, Minister of Finance and the individual legally responsible for the sale. The revelations caused widespread critique of Bjarni, the oversight committee, and the coalition government in power. There were also claims of insider trading, as significant numbers of investors sold off their holdings within days and weeks after a climb in price. In total, the sale involved 450 million shares in the bank to 207 investors. The selling price was ISK 117 per share and the sale proceeds amounted to ISK 52.7 billion (USD 361,000,000; EUR 351,000,000). The state’s share in Íslandsbanki is now 42.5%. Now, the Icelandic National Audit Office is trying to determine the nature of the sale, how the investors were selected, and how the Íslandsbanki share were valued. The official report can be seen here. According to the report, the sale could have been better prepared and executed. Outside the scope of the report are the legitimacy and legality of the sale, which are left to the Financial Supervision Authority of the Central Bank of Iceland. Instead, the report focuses on the technical execution of the sale and its valuation of the shares. According to the report, “the language used in the documents submitted by the Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI) to parliament was not suitable for drawing a clear picture of the arrangement of the sale process. Despite the experience and knowledge of the employees and the board of the Banking Authority in the field of administration and sale of the state’s holdings in financial companies, the institution did not have experience in bidding arrangements in the run-up to the sale […] Adequate conditions were not given to supervisors, sales consultants and dealers, and due to shortcomings in the implementation, demand was underestimated when deciding on the indicative final price. Sufficient consideration was not given to possible reputational risks, nor were the principles of transparency observed. As the bidding system was implemented, it could not guarantee full equality for the investors to whom it was directed.” The report also identifies an over-reliance on external consultants in the private sector.      ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0
764,Iceland Review,Hrísey Island Receives Development Grant of ISK Ten Million,2022/11/13,"Hrísey Island has received a regional development grant of ISK ten million, RÚV reports. The Áfram Hrísey (‘Onwards, Hrísey’) grant is intended to increase available housing and draw new residents to the island. The island of Hrísey is located 35 km [22 mi] north of Akureyri and although small (approx. 7.67 km2 or 2.96 mi2), is known for its rich bird life. Forty species of birds make their home on Hrísey, with ptarmigans being particularly prolific. It is also home to the largest breeding colony of Arctic terns in Europe. By comparison, however, only 200 people live on the island, and this is something that the grant seeks to address. “Right now, our most pressing issue is housing,” says resident Ásrún Ýr Gestsdóttir, who has been hired as the grant’s project manager. “We have people who want to move here, but we don’t have housing for them. We have a lot of houses, but almost half of them are empty for most of the month or the year.” The grant will make it possible to accelerate the process of building new housing and drawing more people to the island full-time. “Up until now, almost everything has been done by volunteers here…we’ve just been doing it whenever possible, sending news to the media while eating dinner. Right now, there’s only one person submitting something for us and contacting the planning department in Akureyri and the town council and people we need to call.” “We hope that when this project ends in spring 2024, we’ll have seen some progress,” says Ásrún Ýr. “That there will have been some construction and that more people will have moved here with either a permanent presence in our remote work center or even gotten started with something new, new employment opportunities.”",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
765,Iceland Review,Hell’s Angels Expelled from Iceland,2022/11/12,"Twenty-two members of the Hell’s Angels motorcycle gang were deported from Iceland on Saturday morning. The Hell’s Angels are one of several motorcycle gangs that are gaining ground in Iceland and the expelled members have suspected ties to organized crime. Vísir reported first. The individuals had apparently come to Iceland to attend a gathering in the capital area. Icelandic police have protocols in place to address the arrival of “people connected to motorcycle clubs” and were ready and waiting when 15 members of the Hell’s Angels landed at the airport from Germany. These individuals were detained and questioned while authorities determined whether they would be allowed to enter the country. No arrests were made at the airport, although seven of their fellow club members were stopped and arrested by police on the road to/from the airport on the same day. Those individuals had flown to Iceland from Sweden. RÚV reports that the cases of five other Hell’s Angels members who arrived from Denmark are still under review, but it is assumed that they came to Iceland to attend the same gathering. This is not the first time this year that members of international motorcycle clubs have been expelled from Iceland upon arrival.

766,Iceland Review,Herring Era Museum Floods: ‘The exhibition area was basically floating’,2022/11/12,"The award-winning Herring Era Museum in Siglufjörður in North Iceland flooded on Friday, RÚV reports. Staff were met by 40 cm [15.7 in] of water when they arrived, and two days of heavy rain have only exacerbated the situation. Wellsprings located in the embankment behind the museum tend to collect water underground, and these simply overflowed after days of heavy rainfall. The runoff had no good drainage channel, something that fire chief Jóhann K. Jóhannsson says will need to be addressed in the future. “[The water] rose really quickly,” said curator Aníta Elefsen. “Around noon, it had reached 77 cm [30 in] and the exhibition area was basically floating, I think that’s the only word for it.” Artifacts and cultural relics at risk Located in a former salting station, boathouse, and herring factory in the centre of Siglufjörður, the Herring Era Museum offers an extensive, immersive glimpse into a fascinating period of Icelandic history. The museum has received numerous awards for its innovative curation and live exhibitions. It is, in fact, the only museum in the country to have won the European Museum Award. Unfortunately, it’s the main exhibition space that has flooded, and although firefighters have been running numerous pumps since Friday, they were still draining water away eight hours later, on Saturday morning. “I think we’re using every available pump in the municipality,” said Aníta. She says it’s difficult to determine the extent of the damage to the collection at this time but hopes that staff will be able to start doing so early next week. “Obviously, this is a great deal of water and it’s the exhibition space we’re talking about. There are artifacts and cultural relics.

Sigurveig Pétursdóttir, 64, has been employed as a doctor for 38 years. She’s spent 30 years working with disabled children as a paediatric orthopedist. At an annual meeting of the Icelandic Medical Association, held on October 14, Sigurveig told Minister of Health Willum Þór Þórsson that the state of the hospital “has never been worse.” Read More: Mass Resignations at the University Hospital “I’ve got children who’ve waited a year,” she called out from the assembly hall, according to a transcript of the meeting published by the Icelandic Medical Journal: “A disabled child who walks with one leg crooked for an entire year because there’s no space in the operating room. And why is there no space? Well, because the staff has quit. It’s not a matter of not having the staff. They quit. The hospital’s a mess. It’s a mess right now. It’s not going to become a mess tomorrow. It didn’t happen yesterday.” Sigurveig preempted familiar bureaucratic talking points with the statement that all talk of analysis and assessment was unacceptable: “I’ve heard it a hundred times, but the situation has never been worse than now,” she stated. “It means nothing to me, being told that I did so well during the pandemic, not having missed a day of work.” “I’m on my knees,” she continued. “I’m giving up, and I’m not the kind of person who gives up when things get rough. But no one will be able to walk in my shoes. No one!” Those present at the annual meeting urged the government to heed the will of the public and to increase healthcare funding. They also announced their disappointment in next year’s budget bill, urged healthcare institutions to ensure the safety of their staff, and called for actions to be taken to deal with the failing health of doctors and the growing number of healthcare professionals who are resigning from their jobs. In late October, sixteen middle managers employed at the National University Hospital of Iceland received letters of termination. The terminations stemmed from the adoption of a new organisational chart intended to improve the hospital’s operations. “The main purpose is to get a handle on the hospital’s management and operations, to strengthen our clinical services, and to harmonise other key services,” Runólfur remarked in an interview with RÚV.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0
768,Iceland Review,Custody of Domestic Terror Suspects Extended by Two Weeks,2022/11/11,"The two individuals suspected of planning a domestic terror attack will be held in custody for another two weeks, Vísir reports. A defence attorney has called the decision “incomprehensible” in light of a psychiatric assessment that held that the men were neither a danger to themselves nor others. Four Icelandic men were arrested on September 21 suspected of “terrorist plots” against state institutions and civilians. Two of the suspects were immediately released; the other two have remained in custody. According to the police, the suspects had hoarded numerous weapons – including dozens of semi-automatic guns and 3D-printed components – alongside a considerable amount of ammunition. The men, both of whom are in their twenties, had discussed carrying out attacks against political figures, among them Minister Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson and Chairman of Efling, Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir. As noted by Vísir yesterday, the two men were initially placed in custody on the basis of investigative interests, but the current extension, as confirmed by the Reykjavík District Court, was predicated on public interest, with the men believed to be a danger to the public. In an interview with Vísir yesterday, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, defence attorney for one of the men, stated that the decision was founded on a threat analysis carried out by the National Police Department. “I’ve criticised the fact that the threat assessment, which actually predated the psychiatric assessment, did not take the psychiatric assessment into account.” According to Sveinn, the psychiatrist who carried out the assessment at the behest of the police did not believe the men to be a threat to themselves or others. The District Court, however, did not take this assessment into account. Sveinn Andri added that his client would be appealing the District Court’s decision, which was a big disappointment, to the Court of Appeal. “It’s always disappointing for individuals who are in custody without good reason to have to remain in custody. But we’ll simply have to deal with it and try to have the decision overturned in the Court of Appeals. That would be ideal.” In late October, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson dismissed private messages between the suspects as a “failed attempt at humour,” adding that he did not believe that either of the men would be charged with planning a terrorist attack.",Society,0,0,0,0,1,0

Nana Bule, a representative for Microsoft, stated to RÚV: “We’ve been fortunate enough to have really high quality data sets on the Icelandic language, which means that we’ve in very short time improved language recognition for Icelandic by 32%. Which may sound small, but is actually a very big improvement that would normally have taken 5 to 10 years.” Earlier this May, an Icelandic delegation including President Guðni Th.

Following the May meetings, representatives from Microsoft have been visiting Iceland this week to report on progress made. Now, the meetings seem to be bearing fruit, with surprisingly fast improvements for the integration of Icelandic into digital services. Mrs. Bule stated that Icelanders will soon be able to speak Icelandic to their devices without a problem. Bule also stated with regard to speech recognition: “We can already do that today, but my hope is that in the future, we will be able to do it much more fluently. In the future, an interview could be you asking me questions in Icelandic, me answering in English, but listeners could hear it in Icelandic hopefully because we’ll be able to translate it in real time.” President Guðni Th.

The namesake of all other geysers, Geysir is a well-known tourist attraction in Iceland and part of the “Golden Circle,” a popular drive near the capital area. However, many natural sites have been overwhelmed by increased tourism, leading to several sites including Skógafoss and Geysir being designated “at risk” in recent years. The Geysir area was originally protected by law in 2020, but this status is just now being recognized in a signing ceremony. In addition to being a popular tourism destination, Geysir is home to many unique geological features, plant life, and microorganisms, meaning that the area is also important for scientific research. In addition to conserving the Geysir area, the new management plan hopes to place increased emphasis on education on Geysir’s significance. At the ceremony, Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated: “The conservation of the Geysir area is an important step in nature conservation in Iceland, given its unique natural beauty. The conservation plan confirmed today ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy the area as we do today.” Minister Guðlaugur added: “This management and protection plan presents ways to ensure that the objectives of conservation are achieved. When developing infrastructure, consideration should be given to local planning […] Development should guide visitors around the area and ensure that its conservation value is maintained.” Þórdís Björt Sigþórsdóttir, manager of conservation and planning at the Environmental Agency, was also present for the ceremony.

RÚV reports that an earthquake measuring 4.9 was detected around the island at 4 AM on Thursday morning; since then, there have been roughly 2,600 earthquakes. At 1:20 PM on Friday, there was another large quake of 4.1 and several over a magnitude of 3.0 occurred after that. Per the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, an Uncertainty Phase is “is characterized by an event which has already started and could lead to a threat to people, properties, communities or the environment. At this stage the collaboration and coordination between the Civil Protection Authorities and stakeholders begins. Monitoring, assessment, research and evaluation of the situation is increased. The event is defined and a hazard assessment is conducted regularly.” People who live in known earthquake areas in Northeast Iceland are advised to take appropriate measures to prepare for ongoing seismic activity. These include securing household items, such as flatscreen TVs and breakable décor, taking down paintings or photos that can fall on people while sleeping, moving beds away from windows, and familiarizing oneself with the Duck – Cover – Hold procedure. More information on natural disaster preparedness can be found on the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management’s website, in English, here.

Three weeks have elapsed since any volcanic activity was detected in the area. On July 30, an Uncertainty Phase was declared on Reykjanes after a swarm of earthquakes rocked the peninsula. Four days later, on August 3, a volcanic eruption began, as magma began spewing out of several-hundred-metre-long fissures in a lava field near Fagradalsfjall, which had been created by last year’s eruption in the same location. An Emergency Phase was subsequently declared, which was lowered to an Alert Phase in light of the relative smallness of the eruption. The eruption passed through several phases before all activity ceased on Saturday, August 20. Yesterday, the National Police Commissioner, in consultation with the Suðurnes Police, decided to revoke the Alert and Uncertainty Phases that had been in effect in the area, RÚV reports.

Residents are encouraged to secure furniture and other household items to prevent injury and/or damages to their homes,” a press release from the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management reads. The press release also states that rangers will be positioned at the eruption site to monitor foot traffic. The presence of police and rescue workers will be gradually diminished in the area, although they will be dispatched if needed.

778,Iceland Review,"Summer’s “Finally Here,” Meteorologist Declares",2022/09/02,"Speaking to Fréttablaðið yesterday, meteorologist Sigurður Þ. Ragnarsson announced the late arrival of the Icelandic summer. According to Sigurður, good weather is expected in Iceland over the coming days, and may even last a few weeks. “Summer’s finally here,” Sigurður Þ. Ragnarsson, known more familiarly as Storm Siggi, declared in an interview with Fréttablaðið yesterday; notwithstanding warm weather in North Iceland last week, this year’s summer has generally received tepid reviews. According to Sigurður, however, the weather is expected to greatly improve over the coming weeks – with warmth and stillness being the operative words. “We see very warm air gathering in the upper atmosphere, especially to the north of the country, near eastern Greenland,” Sigurður told Fréttablaðið. “This is warm air that you usually don’t see this time of year. There’s also this pressure ridge building over the country, straddling the Atlantic, which would, if everything works out, push any low-pressure systems to the south. These two factors create warm, calm, and dry weather for the entire country, which could remain well into the middle of September – or even longer,” Sigurður remarked. Sigurður added that many “noteworthy” and “exciting” developments were on the horizon over the next few weeks. “Yes, you heard right: weeks. One almost wants to say – Friday notwithstanding – that the summer’s finally here.” Although warm weather is expected over the coming weeks, Sigurður tempered expectations with the caveat that Icelanders would not see any record-breaking temperatures; whenever warm air accumulates in the upper atmosphere, wind is required to pull the warmth down to the surface. “This wind isn’t in our forecasts, so we’re not expecting any records to fall, but, nevertheless, unseasonably warm weather. It’s worth mentioning that whenever you have this persistent low-pressure zone hovering over the country, cloud cover becomes difficult to predict – especially if the sea breeze comes into effect,” Sigurður observed, adding that the weather should begin to improve over the weekend. “I’m on cloud nine, for my own part, with the prospect of an Indian summer – in the capital area, as well. It’s actually all of Iceland that will be experiencing this pleasant weather for roughly two weeks. If everything works out, this will also help to extend berry and mushroom-picking season, and may even extend the harvest time among potato patches.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
779,Iceland Review,Sunken Truck Recovered from Arctic Expedition,2022/09/01,"This Sunday, August 28, rescue divers and helicopter teams salvaged a truck from the Arctic Ocean that had been lost on an expedition last March. The original expedition and subsequent salvage mission was organized by Transglobal Car Expedition, but Icelandic company Arctic Trucks was also involved and present for both. The truck in question was lost this March it fell through the ice on an expedition, which was an attempt to drive from Yellowknife, Canada to Resolute Bay. The trip was training for a larger expedition around the world, but it was cut short when one of the trucks was lost to the ice. Luckily, all of the crew escaped safely. However, local communities critiqued the expedition operator, and said that the truck threatened to pollute traditional fishing grounds. Emil Grímsson, a representative for the expedition, said in a statement that although they did not want to minimize concerns over potential pollution, that they would have to wait for suitable conditions to salvage the truck. The conditions were finally right last week, and the truck was successfully lifted from its resting place, 15m beneath the sea. Due to unfavorable water currents, dive teams working in coordination with a helicopter only had several short windows in which to carry out the operation. In a public post on their Facebook, Arctic Trucks stated: “Two boats were first launched to explore the area and locate the AT44. The diving team then began inspecting the vehicle underwater. Despite initially strong currents and rapid ice movement nearby, subsequent good weather conditions, clear water and superb visibility in the Arctic Ocean aided swift progress. After carefully attaching the lines and flotation bags, the truck (still upside down) was carefully moved to a shallower depth, before being turned onto its wheels and pulled onshore. The team were also able to recover all the equipment and personal items from the vehicle.” After the fourth attempt, the truck was finally lifted onto land, as can be seen in the dramatic photographs above. Upon recovering the vehicle, Arctic Trucks stated: “The vehicle will now be made ready for loading onto the next available sealift vessel to Montreal. The safe and successful completion of this recovery operation left the site in pristine condition, preserving the beautiful yet fragile Arctic ecosystem.” The truck is considered a total loss after nearly a half year under water. In addition to the salvage teams, local residents were present as well. In a statement, a team member called it a privilege to work with them, and that it was an honor to be shown their camps and hunting grounds that stretch back for hundreds of years.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0

The fish were reported to MAST on August 26 and samples are now being analysed to determine their origin. Escaped salmon poses a risk to wild salmon populations, as cross-breeding could diminish wild salmon’s chances of survival. Iceland’s aquaculture industry has been expanding rapidly in recent years. While some aquaculture is practiced on land, the majority of fish farms in Iceland are open-net sea farms. Such farms now operate in several of the Westfjords: Dýrafjörður, Arnarfjörður, Tálknafjörður, and Patreksfjörður. The industry’s expansion has not been without opposition from environmental groups and local residents. In 2019, a petition signed by 18,000 people calling for a stop to open-net fish farming was handed over to the Icelandic Parliament. There have been previous instances of escaped farmed salmon caught in the wild in Iceland, including as early as 2018. MAST will publish more information on the fish once their DNA has been sequenced.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0

Critiquing the birds’ aggression and dominance at Tjörnin, the Reykjavík city pond, Kjartan stated to RÚV: “Some use the analogy that the seagull is like a flying rat. I don’t want to speak so strongly, but I understand the analogy well when you see them among the ducks and ducklings here at the pond.” Concretely, the proposal aims to heighten Reykjavík’s gull-deterrent capabilities by firing warning shots to scare the gulls, increasing signage to not feed the birds. The proposal is only the latest flashpoint in Reykjavík’s fraught history in human-seabird relations. In 2007, some 60-70 seagulls were anaesthetized in the capital area. The gulls were tranquilized with drug-laced breadcrumbs and then given lethal injections. However, the initiative came under critique for being unscientific and unethical. Additionally, the initiative was shown to be ineffective, with a cost of ISK 17.000 per bird, and an unclear, if any, impact on the gull population.    ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
783,Iceland Review,Low Air Quality Attributed to Sand,2022/08/30,"Air quality in the capital region has been poor due to the concentration of sand particulates from South Iceland, announced the City of Reykjavík yesterday. According to the Meteorological Office of Iceland, the source of the sand particulates is a sandstorm on the South Coast, from high winds in the last days. Those with respiratory sensitivities and small children are asked to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities if they feel any difficulty breathing or other discomfort. At 12.00 yesterday, August 29, the particulate concentration at Grensásvegur was measured at 121 micrograms per cubic meter, and 272 micrograms at Háaleitisbraut. Guidelines for 24-hour health protection limits recommend PM10 (denoting particulates with diameters of 10 micrometers) concentrations no higher than 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

784,Iceland Review,Scrapie-Resistant Sheep to Enter Market this Fall,2022/08/30,"Up to 15 rams with scrapie-resistant genes will be sold for breeding this fall. Bred in Reyðarfjörður in East Iceland, the sheep carry a special gene and it is hoped that they will help form a more resilient stock in Iceland. The gene, called ARR, is not found anywhere else in Iceland. It has been recognised internationally as scrapie-resistant, and herds with the ARR gene have already been bred in Europe for some two decades. Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease found in sheep and goats, the ovine equivalent of mad cow disease. There is no cure, and even one case of scrapie can be a death sentence for an entire agricultural community. If a sheep tests positive for scrapie, the entire herd is culled, the entire farm’s hay must be destroyed, and the entire farm and its implements must be sanitised, either chemically or through fire. Even after this deep-cleaning, farmers are not able to raise sheep for a set time, and the scorched-earth policy may even affect neighboring herds and farms. After the ARR gene was found out East, an effort was made to breed the gene into the stock as much as possible. There are now some 50 total rams that carry the gene. Steinn Björnsson, a farmer in Reyðarfjörður, has said that the rams are expected to go for a modest amount. In an interview with RÚV, he stated “after all, sheep farmers have so little money that they would never be able to buy this if they were any more expensive.” In a recent statement on their website, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority has designated priority zones for the resistant stock. With only a small supply of the so-called “golden rams,” the stock is to be used as effectively as possible, with farming communities recently affected by scrapie and with herds of 300 or more given first priority. For the full story on the fight against scrapie and the efforts to breed this new, resistant stock, read more in our article: Good Breeding. ","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
785,Iceland Review,Polar Bear Turned Out to Be a Seal,2022/08/29,"Iceland’s Coast Guard sent a helicopter out on an unusual call yesterday afternoon when hikers in the Westfjords’ Hornstrandir Nature Reserve reported sighting a polar bear. While the white giants are not native to Iceland, they have been known to drift to the north coast on sea ice on rare occasions. Two Westfjords Police officers rode out with the helicopter, which was accompanied on the mission by search and rescue ship Gísli Jón. The helicopter crew flew over Hornvík bay (where the sighting had been made) and the surrounding area, as well as spoke to the hikers, who were convinced that they had seen a polar bear. A notice from Westfjords Police states: “No bear was found. The animal that the people believed was a polar bear seems to have been a large, white-coloured grey seal that had been spotted recently in Hornvík.” Westfjords Police thanked the Coast Guard and ICE-SAR for their collaboration on the call out, adding: “Better safe than sorry.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

There has been no volcanic activity in Meradalir since last weekend. According to a new assessment report published by the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, the entire trail to the Meradalir eruption site on the Reykjanes peninsula has been repaired. As noted in the report, visitors to the eruption site have decreased dramatically over the past week: approximately 1,000-1,500 people currently visit the site on a daily basis, compared to 3,000-4,000 previously. In light of the decrease in foot traffic, the presence of response parties has been reduced. Police officers and paramedics handle patient transport in the area, in the event of accidents, and search-and-rescue works will continue to collaborate with response parties over the weekend to ensure the transfer of responsibilities. The further involvement of search-and-rescue parties in monitoring the area will be assessed next week. The report also notes that since no volcanic activity has been detected at the eruption site since Sunday morning, the Meradalir eruption has likely come to an end. The Meteorological Office of Iceland, however, is hesitant to make an official statement as of yet. An alert phase is still in effect. The eruption began on August 3.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
787,Iceland Review,Citizen Scientists Wanted to Monitor Land,2022/08/25,"GróLind, a project to monitor Iceland’s soil and vegetation resources through remote sensing data, is turning to the public for help. Jóhann Helgi Stefánsson, environmental scientist and project manager at GróLind, has stated that the project “is an opportunity for people to monitor the land in an organized way, see the results of reforestation, see the development of vegetation and have a direct impact on the knowledge we are creating every day.” GróLind’s land monitoring began in 2019. Among other research goals, the project investigates sheep grazing patterns, and how vegetation develops on grazed and protected lands. Now, the project is looking for citizen volunteers to help gather further data. Volunteers will use an app, and along with some basic training, monitor small areas of land throughout the country. By using a pole provided by Landgræðslan, Iceland’s foundation for land reclamation, volunteers will mark the center of a 50m area in diameter and report the findings back to GróLind. In combination with other systems like satellite imagery, the data will hopefully contribute to a fuller picture of land use in Iceland.

790,Iceland Review,Meradalir Eruption Likely Over,2022/08/22,"The Icelandic Met Office is not ready to pronounce the Meradalir eruption officially over, but the dwindling volcanic tremor finally came to a stop at the site on Saturday night. There is no longer visible lava flow from the main crater, and while there is still some activity in the main vent, it is likely already closed. “The activity at the Meradalir vents and the associated tremor has been dwindling gradually over the last three days, to such a degree that at this moment no fountaining is visible at the vents and the tremor is almost non-existent,” the Volcanology and Natural Hazard Group of the University of Iceland wrote on their Facebook page on Saturday afternoon. “However, there is still steady venting of magmatic gases. This trend in the eruptive behavior is very different from that observed at the end of individual eruption episodes in the 2021 eruption, which were terminated very abruptly. Hence, it is likely that this rather slow and gradual decline in activity is signifying the demise [of] the 2022 Meradalir eruption.” The Meradalir eruption began on August 3 around 1:18 pm, not far from last year’s Geldingadalir eruption, on Southwest Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula. By August 13, lava flow had decreased significantly around 10 days later to about one third of the original rate. Now all volcanic tremor has ceased, and the main vent appears to be closed. In order to formally declare the eruption over, however, there must be no activity at the site for several days or weeks. While some who had not had a chance to see the eruption yet may be disappointed, residents of the Reykjanes peninsula are likely relieved the lava flow was contained to Meradalir valley, where it did not threaten nearby roads or energy infrastructure. Search and rescue crews who had been monitoring the site and its tens of thousands of visitors are also likely looking forward to some time off. Volcanologists and geologists have stated that the Meradalir and Geldingadalir eruptions mark the beginning of a new active volcanic period on the Reykjanes peninsula that could last decades or even centuries.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
791,Iceland Review,Sail from Sweden to Iceland to Mark 250th Anniversary of Scientific Expedition,2022/08/22,"The year 2022 marks 250 years since the Swedish botanist Daniel Solander made a scientific expedition to Iceland. To commemorate the expedition, the Embassy of Sweden has collaborated with Icelandic partners to organise a sailing trip, an art exhibition, workshops, nature walks, and other projects that will be held at over 30 locations across Iceland over the next one and a half years. “Together Iceland and Sweden continue a dialogue on history, biology, geology, anthropology and culture which has spanned over many centuries. The project deals with our common past, present and future,” Sweden’s Ambassador to Iceland Pär Ahlberger told Iceland Review. “I am very grateful to the Government of Iceland and our more than 30 Icelandic partners for the very generous support to this, the most comprehensive Swedish – Icelandic project ever.” Daniel Solander (1733-1782) was a Swedish naturalist who studied under celebrated professor of botany Carl Linnaeus. He travelled as far as Australia and New Zealand for scientific expeditions, where he helped make and describe collections of plants from various regions. Solander visited Iceland in 1772. A travelogue from the expedition, Letters on Iceland, first published in 1777, is available in full on the Icelandic National Library website. One of the cornerstones of the commemorative project is the art exhibition Solander 250: Bréf frá Íslandi (e. Solander 250: Letters from Iceland), which features the work of ten Icelandic artists who contribute with their perspectives of Daniel Solander’s expedition to Iceland. The exhibition opens in Hafnarborg gallery in the town of Hafnarfjörður on August 27, but will travel to nine other locations in Iceland over the coming 18 months. The exhibition Paradise Lost – Daniel Solander’s Legacy, first exhibited in New Zealand and Australia in 2019-2021 and focusing on the first encounter between Sweden and the Pacific Region, will be shown across Iceland alongside Bréf frá Íslandi.

792,Iceland Review,Awareness of Off-Road Driving Ban Lacking in Iceland,2022/08/18,"Three Italian tourists have pleaded guilty to off-road driving in Iceland’s Central Highland, north of Vatnajökull glacier. Off-road driving is illegal in Iceland and those who are caught must pay hefty fines. The director of the Travel Association of Fljótsdalshérað, East Iceland, says more must be done to ensure foreign tourists are aware of the ban. Þórhallur Þorsteinsson has been working in tourism in East Iceland for decades. He posted pictures of the damage done by the three Italians on his Facebook page, calling the deep tire tracks among the worst he’s ever seen.  Þórhallur told Vísir he’s tired of seeing such damage and says tourism operators and the government must do more to get the message across that off-road driving is illegal in Iceland. Smyril Line, which operates the ferry between mainland Europe and Seyðisfjörður, East Iceland, as well as car rental companies, the Environment Ministry, and the municipality of Múlaþing, East Iceland, are a few of the parties Þórhallur mentioned as bearing the responsibility to educate tourists on the fragile environment they are visiting in Iceland, that takes decades to recover from damage caused by off-road driving. When tourists lack awareness of the off-road driving ban, damage can lead to even more damage. “Then tourists come and see an old circle made off-road. Then they take a spin themselves; think about doing it themselves. ‘Why not me?’” Þórhallur explains. In addition to tourism operators and local authorities, Þórhallur says the Icelandic government bears the largest responsibility to ensure off-road driving does not happen. The three Italian tourists have been fined several hundred thousand Icelandic krónur, or thousands of euros, for the offence.","Nature,Travel",0,0,1,0,0,0
793,Iceland Review,Glacial Flood Expected in West Iceland,2022/08/18,"A relatively high water level in a glacier lagoon by Langjökull glacier, West Iceland, suggests that a flood can be expected from the lagoon in the near future. Such floods have occurred before and are known to cause a very rapid water level rise in the rivers Svartá and Hvítá in the Borgarfjörður area. The Volcanology and Natural Hazard Group and the University of Iceland published satellite images of the lagoon and surrounding area yesterday, showing a high water level in the lagoon. At least three floods have occurred from the lagoon before in the last few years; in August 2020, August 2017, and September 2014. Typically, the floodwater runs under the glacier toward the southwest, where it runs into Svartá and then from that river into Hvítá. The Icelandic Met Office is monitoring the situation, in part with water level measuring equipment in Hvítá, which will be able to detect the peak of the flood.

794,Iceland Review,Lava Flow in Meradalir Drops Significantly,2022/08/17,"The most recent data published by the Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland indicates that the flow of lava from the Meradalir eruption has slowed significantly. Where the lava averaged 11 m³/s from August 4 – 13, the most recent information indicates a much lower level of 3 – 4 m³/s from August 13 – 15. As of August 16, the flow was recorded at 2 m³/s, but geologists say that these figures are relatively uncertain. The report can be seen in a Facebook post from the University of Iceland’s Institute of Earth Sciences. Weather over the weekend allowed for information to be collected by aircraft. Imagery from the Pleiades satellites, a European satellite constellation for high-resolution imaging, has also been used to monitor the flow.  In the recent report, it is also noted that working with such time spans of days and weeks is especially difficult. It is currently impossible to say whether the recent decrease represents a temporary low in a long-term eruption, or if the eruption is already beginning to wind down.

High winds and rain are expected in these regions for much of the day. The inclement weather is due to a low-pressure system situated over the southwest of Iceland, which will determine the weather for the coming days. The region will see considerable rain and winds into the afternoon, with showers expected through many other regions of the country. Conditions in the highlands are expected to be the worst, with winds between 18 – 25 m/s, and localized gusts possibly reaching 35 m/s northwest of Vatnajökull. Tourists and hikers are advised that such conditions are potentially dangerous. Such high winds can also present a danger to vehicle traffic. The Faxaflói bay will likewise see strong winds today, with a range of 13 – 20 m/s expected. Local gusts near the mountains may be stronger, approaching 25 m/s near Kjalarnes. Conditions in the North of Iceland are comparatively milder, with temperatures approaching 15°C (59°F) in Akureyri and Húsavík, although the coming days are expected to bring rain and clouds.

797,Iceland Review,Proposed Sand Mine Would Operate Trucks at 7- to 8-Minute Intervals Along Ring Road,2022/08/16,"Large transport trucks could be driving along Iceland’s South Coast at 7- to 8-minute intervals – 24 hours a day – if German company EP Power Minerals’ plan to open a sand mine east of Vík is realised. The sand would be exported to Europe and possibly North America, where it would be used as an additive in cement. The company plans to ship the material from Þorlákshöfn, but the local mayor says the town does not have adequate facilities for its storage and EP Power Minerals is yet to apply for a lot in the harbour. An environmental evaluation of the proposal published earlier this month judged the project’s impact on traffic and noise pollution to be “considerably negative.” Its impact on birdlife, plant life, and the geology of the area was, however, evaluated as “insignificantly negative.” EP Power Minerals purchased the land where the proposed mine is to be located in 2020. Some 15 km [9.3 mi] east of Vík í Mýrdal, the property stretches from Kötlujökull glacier down to the coast, and consists mostly of sand plains. The property was listed for sale in 2016 by its former owners, three siblings who have stated that they made several unsuccessful attempts to sell it to the Icelandic state. The land was sold to EP Power Minerals through the company Mýrdalssandur ehf., in which three Icelanders own a 10% share (through the company Lásastígur ehf.). The proposed mine would be located by Hafursey mountain and north of the Ring Road, which runs through the property. The proposed mining area covers 15.5 square kilometres and it is estimated that the usable sand within the area measures around 146 million cubic metres. According to the mining plans, there should be enough material within that area for 100 years of mining. EP Power Minerals plans to transport the sand by truck to Þorlákshöfn. The amount of material would entail a full truck leaving the mine every 15 minutes, and empty trucks returning from Þorlákshöfn at the same rate. This means that transport trucks will be driving at 7-8 minute intervals 24 hours a day along the ring road between Vík and Hveragerði, as well as on the roads between Hveragerði and Þorlákshöfn. Residents of the capital area and South Iceland have expressed concern at the impact this transport would have on traffic and roads in the area. Jóhannes Þór Skúlason, CEO of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association, also expressed concern about the impact the mine and its associated traffic would have. “There has been talk about the tourism industry in that regard, but it’s recognised that one heavy truck such as those that transport fish between regions, it damages the road to the equivalent of 10,000 Yaris cars or small rental cars,” Jóhannes Þór told Vísir, expressing doubt as to whether road infrastructure could handle so much heavy transport. He added that a project such as the mine would affect the experience of tourists in the area. The environmental evaluation conducted by Efla and published earlier this month judged many of the mine’s negative impacts to be negligible. Its impact on plant life and birdlife in the area was considered “insignificantly negative,” as the sand plains in question are not a habitat for endangered or protected plant species and the mine would not greatly impact nesting areas. Despite the fact that the mine would have a “direct and permanent effect on the sedimentation of Mýrdalssandur,” the effect would only be on a “tiny percentage of the total formation,” lowering the surface by 10 metres at a site where the sand is 120 metres thick. Therefore, Efla’s assessment was that the overall impact on geological formations would be “insignificantly negative.” The same was determined of the mine’s impact on tourism and outdoor recreation in the area. The project’s climate impact was considered to be “considerably positive,” as the material produced would replace cement clinker and would therefore reduce carbon emissions due to concrete production by 800 million kg of CO2 equivalents annually (when emissions due to transportation are taken into account).","Business,Nature,Society",1,0,1,0,1,0
798,Iceland Review,Animal Welfare Inspectors to Join Whaling Ships,2022/08/16,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) will regularly monitor whether whaling companies are complying with Icelandic laws on animal welfare, thanks to a new regulation implemented by Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir. The Directorate of Fisheries will conduct the monitoring. Only one company is actively whaling in Iceland and Svandís has suggested that their licence will not be renewed after 2023. The Directorate of Fisheries will be responsible for sending inspectors on whale hunting trips, making video recordings of hunting methods, and keeping a registry of them, according to a government notice. All inspection data will be sent to the supervising veterinarian. The Directorate will also monitor whether the whaling ships are complying with the requirements of their licence, such as regulations on fishing equipment. “It’s a cause for celebration that these key institutions will collaborate on the inspection,” Svandís stated. “That’s where the expertise lies and the data collected will be able to confirm whether whaling is practised according to law.” The regulation has already taken effect and monitoring will start immediately. The notice does not clarify whether inspectors will be present on all whaling expeditions. Whaling restarted in Iceland in June 2022 following a four-year hiatus. In an op-ed published in Morgunblaðið newspaper, Svandís stated there is little evidence the practice is economically beneficial to Iceland. The current government regulations allow for whaling until the year 2023, and Svandís stated she sees little reason to permit the practice after that licence expires.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
799,Iceland Review,Meradalir Eruption: Two Rangers “A Drop in the Ocean” of What is Needed,2022/08/15,"Over 13,000 people visited the ongoing eruption in Iceland’s Meradalir valley over the weekend. A significant number of them were ill-prepared for the challenging 14-kilometre [8.7-mile] hike, according to Search and Rescue crews. The Icelandic government has promised to hire rangers to monitor the site, but they would only be a drop in the ocean of what is needed to manage the constant flow of visitors, says Bogi Adolfsson, head of the ICE-SAR Division Þorbjörn. “We’ve ended up doing a lot of different things, managing the parking lot, directing traffic, assisting police, transport this and that [injured visitor], giving them our packed lunch, it’s gone that far,” Bogi told RÚV. “Rangers help a lot, but two, or two full-time equivalents, I don’t know which it is [that the government has promised], is in my opinion just half of what’s needed. It’s a drop in the ocean.” Bogi stated he wanted to see more police stationed at the site, but that would require strengthening the local police division. Since the Meradalir eruption began on August 3, over 35 search and rescue crews involving some 350 people had taken part in projects connected to the eruption site. The majority of search and rescue crew members are volunteers. In a lengthy Facebook post, ICE-SAR Director Otti Sigmarsson pointed out that monitoring a tourist site full-time was outside of the typical role of search and rescue teams. Like Bogi, Otti called on strengthening the local police force, more funding to the Civil Protection Department, rangers, and other initiatives to take over the daily monitoring of the site from search and rescue volunteers, who could then focus on their usual role at the eruption site: responding to emergencies. While authorities have underlined that the hike to the Meradalir eruption is not for the inexperienced or the ill-prepared, that has not stopped some from setting out to see the lava without proper equipment or even food or water. Children under 12 years of age have officially been banned access to the site, however, Iceland Review saw several toddler-age children on the hiking path yesterday.

800,Iceland Review,Deflection Dams May Be Built to Divert Lava from Roadway,2022/08/12,"The Department of Civil Protection will likely build deflecting dams to prevent lava from flowing onto Rte. 427, RÚV reports. Also called Suðurstrandavegur, this road runs along the south coast of the Reykjanes peninsula between the municipalities of Grindavík and Ölfus. Lava has yet to start flowing out of the Meradalir valley, but scientists say it’s just a matter of time. At time of writing, the lava around the low-lying mountain pass called Meradalaskarð had reached a height of eight metres [26 ft]. Should it rise a mere metre or so higher, however, it will overflow the valley. On Wednesday, scientists estimated that this could happen over the course of a few hours, but so far, the lava level has been rising slower than anticipated. See Also: Lava Could Reach Reykjanes Roadway If It Rises Any Higher “The lava’s been flowing in other directions since we got this tongue, which has actually reached the pass where it can start to flow out of Meradalir,” explained Kristín Jónsdóttir, the Met Office’s team leader for natural disasters. “And, of course, the way the lava flows is random. Tongues are breaking off from the lake of lava and what we saw yesterday was that the lava was mostly flowing in the immediate vicinity of the crater, mostly to the west and the north.” But currently, it isn’t possible for scientists to say whether the lava will overflow the valley “tomorrow or in a week,” said Kristín. Plan to divert lava from fibre optic cables, important infrastructure Diversion dams are only temporary measures, added Björn Oddsson, a geophysicist with Civil Protection. But experiments erecting these barriers in the path of oncoming lava were successful last year and as such, Björn expects that “the engineers and designers who are working on this will make use of [this experience] and will resort to [diversion dams] if the lava starts to flow toward Suðurstrandavegur or fibre optic cable or other things we want to divert it from.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
801,Iceland Review,Lava Could Reach Reykjanes Roadway If It Rises Any Higher,2022/08/11,"It’s possible that lava from the ongoing eruption in Meradalir could flow eastward in the next 24 hours, RÚV reports. Professor of Geophysics Magnús Tumi Guðmundsson says that if this were to happen, the lava would have a direct path to Rte. 427. Also called Suðurstrandavegur, this road runs along the south coast of the Reykjanes peninsula between the municipalities of Grindavík and Ölfus. Magnús Tumi notes that the lava hasn’t yet started flowing out of Meradalir. “However, in the last two days, the lava by the mountain pass, which is the lowest point out of the valley to the east, has risen seven to eight metres [23-26 feet]. And it will only take maybe a metre or so for it to overflow. So if the situation continues like this, the lava will overflow the valley soon.” It’s difficult to say if the lava would actually reach Suðurstrandavegur, says Magnús Tumi. “But in order to be able to estimate any sort of timeline, it’s vital that we be able to take new measurements of the lava volume and thereby the flow.” Unfortunately, ongoing weather conditions since Thursday have prevented scientists from taking these critical measurements.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
802,Iceland Review,Meradalir Update: Eruption Site Reopened to Public,2022/08/10,"The Meradalir eruption site was reopened today to the public following several days of weather-related closures. The announcement came this morning, following a status update meeting with Suðurnes chief of police Gunnar Schram. The announcement can be seen in a Facebook post below from The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management. Prior to the announcement, tourists had been turned away from the eruption site. Police had set up checkpoints along the road from Grindavík to determine drivers’ destinations. In a statement to Fréttablaðið, Gunnar stated the need for Icelandic authorities to establish clearer lines of communication with visitors, most of whom are foreign tourists. Although weather has been uncooperative for visitors, the eruption is seen by geologists as conforming well to their models, with few surprises. The above satellite image provided by the Meteorological Office shows imaging of earthquakes in the Reykjanes peninsula leading up to the eruption. The deformation northeast of Grindavík, indicated by the black box, is considered to be the source of the M5.5 earthquake that occurred on July 31. Using earthquake and GPS data, geologists have determined that the region’s magma distribution is unchanged, with a steady flow since the beginning of the eruption. The Department of Civil Protection and the Meteorological Office both warn that authorities should prepare for a potentially long-term eruption.

After the two groups were rescued, crews combed the area to ensure no others were in the area and found a few more individuals who were escorted down to the parking lot. The two groups, around ten people in total, had gotten lost on their way to the eruption site, a challenging hike of around 7 kilometres. Some had set off on the hike ill-prepared, despite being told to turn back by search and rescue volunteers who were on site. The Department of Civil Bad weather has announced that the eruption site will remain closed to visitors today due to inclement weather. Authorities will meet at 8:30 AM tomorrow, Wednesday, August 10, to decide whether the site will be reopened.

804,Iceland Review,Eruption Site Closed Today,2022/08/08,"The Meradalir eruption site is closed today, Monday, August 8, due to bad weather and poor conditions on the trail, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management has announced. Crews will use the time to repair the main route, known as Hiking Trail A. Access to the eruption site will be reopened tomorrow, August 9, at 10:00 AM. Suðurnes police emphasise that no search and rescue crews will be on duty today at the eruption site to respond to emergencies. The eruption in Meradalir began on August 3 at 1:18 PM. While it is at least five times larger than last year’s eruption in nearby Geldingadalir, it is still considered a relatively minor eruption. Currently, the lava flow is not threatening roads, infrastructure, or inhabited areas. The hike to the eruption is challenging and not for those who are inexperienced or unprepared. Gas poisoning is a risk that visitors need to be aware of, and staying upwind from eruption fumes is crucial. The site was closed yesterday due to gas pollution.

805,Iceland Review,Local Health Board Asks Again for Akureyri to Monitor Cruise Emissions,2022/08/06,"The Health Board of Northeast Iceland has reissued its request that the Town of Akureyri invest in a device that would monitor cruise ship emissions in the area, RÚV reports. Opinions are divided as to how polluted cruise ship emissions are, but hazy white smoke is often visible hanging over the town when ships are berthed in the harbour. Almost 200,000 tourists travelling on 200 cruise ships will visit Akureyri this summer. There is usually more than one ship in port at the same time and in certain weather conditions, a white haze can be observed hanging over the town. On a windless day, like Friday, exhaust from the cruise ships in Akureyri’s harbour is easily visible. Pétur Ólafsson, Akureyri’s harbour master, says he isn’t concerned about the emissions. “Many of the ships that come to Iceland now have really excellent cleaning equipment, called scrubbers, which clean their exhaust by around 98% so it’s often just steam coming out. People understandably think it’s all pollution, but it isn’t.” While he admitted he hadn’t chemically analysed the haze that was hanging over Akureyri on Friday, Pétur noted that the ships in the harbour on Friday “use legal fuel” and no heavy fuel oil. Scrubbers help, but they also create their own pollutants Heavy fuel oil (HFO) is a widely used but controversial fuel for large vessels. It’s comparatively inexpensive, but has a thick, viscous consistency, has a high sulphur concentration, and is incredibly difficult to clean up in the event of a spill, as evidenced by the 2020 incident in which a Japanese freight carrier started leaking HFO into the Indian Ocean around the coral reefs of Mauritius. As of that same year, Iceland issued a number of restrictions on marine fuels, including limiting the sulphur content in marine fuels used in Iceland and within the pollution jurisdiction of Iceland to .5% and mandating that vessels at berth in ports “shall use shore electricity instead of marine fuels as possible.” In the event that shoreline electricity cannot be used, “vessels in ports in Iceland shall not use marine fuels with a sulphur content exceeding 0.1% (m/m).” But even if the cruise ships aren’t using HFO and are using scrubbers, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t any risk of pollutants and emissions. According to a statement on the subject of scrubbers issued by HFO-Free Arctic in 2019: “Using a scrubber to extract the sulphur from a ship’s exhaust results in the production of scrubber effluent or waste which will need to be disposed of. Most scrubbers are “open loop” which means the waste produced, which can be high in sulphur and also other pollutants such as heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, can be dumped straight into the sea. There are also concerns that if a scrubber malfunctions in cold temperatures or due to ice, ships will continue to burn HFO and will emit high levels of Sulphur.” First request for pollution to be monitored issued in 2019 The Health Board of Northeast Iceland first requested that Akureyri purchase a device that could monitor pollution from cruise ship emissions in 2019. The request was turned down. Alfreð Schiöth, the managing director of the Health Board noted that ports in Faxaflói, the bay that extends between the peninsulas of Reykjanes in the south and Snæfellsnes in the west and also includes Reykjavík and the West Iceland town of Akranes. “The ports along Faxaflói taking doing really precise measurements at present and we’ll be watching them closely because those are the same ships that are coming [north].”  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
806,Iceland Review,Scenes from Meradalir,2022/08/05,"Yes, eruptions are serious business. One has to bring the right equipment, check the conditions, and above all, exercise caution. It is not every day, after all, that one is confronted with the raw, boiling power of earth’s mantle shooting up in glow-in-the-dark orange jets. It is not an everyday experience. Everywhere around you, you see the signs of something exceptional. A holiday air reigns, alternately feeling like a solemn pilgrimage and carnival. Everyone seems to have come for something different. Old couples picnic off to the side of the main event, and wispy teenage boys are wired into VR headsets, piloting their drones over the lava field. Some enjoy a moment of silent contemplation, and others are clearly here for the spectacle and fun of it all. For others, such as geologists and the search and rescue team, the eruption site is an office. Here, we briefly show a few of the many faces and scenes of Meradalir. 







 The slopes above the eruption serves as the perfect vantage point to view the eruption from. The eruption is obscured until the moment hikers crest the hill behind it, and visitors new to the scene can often be heard gasping in surprise when they first see the eruption below. 







 The angle provides an excellent view over the eruption, but doesn’t quite capture the scale of the jets. As we descended the slope, we could better appreciate the magnitude of the eruption. 







 Katrin and Tomas, a German couple, pause on the slopes for a water break. They had taken an even longer route to the eruption site, and had walked some 30km that day. 







 Tóta Maja, from the Search and Rescue team Björgunsveitin Ok, stands by with her partner, Jóhannes. Asked how she felt about the most recent eruption, she said she was very excited, and that so far everyone has been behaving very well. 







 Fashion designer Eva Poleschinski and her photographer struck digital gold last year when one of her pictures from Fagradalsfjall went viral. Here, they hope lightning strikes twice for them. 







 Berglind and Ragnar saw all of the drone footage from last year and just recently got one for themselves. Here they are taking their new drone on its maiden flight. 







 University of Iceland geologists, Catherine Gallagher and Jóna Sigurlína Pálmadóttir, conduct some fieldwork. When we came across them, they were breaking off a chunk of lava to take back for sampling. They said the Meradalir eruption was a very nice, polite eruption: no surprises so far, and away from roads and settlements. 







 J.J. and Carlos were in Iceland for the first time. This was their first eruption, and they seemed like they were having a great time! 







 Laimis has been living in Iceland for three years. He saw many of the pictures from the eruption last year and thought he’d give lava-grilled hot dogs a try (which, by the way, we don’t recommend!). 







 Lucia, Alexandra, and Lila were having a great time taking pictures. Having just moved here two months ago, it was quite the welcoming for Alexandra.

807,Iceland Review,"Shifting Winds Could Mean Gas in Vogar, Garður",2022/08/05,"According to the most recent information from the Meteorological Office of Iceland, shifting winds could blow gas plumes from the eruption north and northwest of the eruption site, towards the towns of Vogar, Reykjanesbær, and Garður. Winds from the South and Southeast are expected today, ranging from 5 to 10m/s. The model below shows a possible distribution for the gas today around 13:00. However, the Meteorological Office warns that SO2 levels in the model may not be entirely up to date. For the most current air quality levels, residents and tourists are encouraged to refer to the Environmental Agency of Iceland’s website. The gas plume currently poses no significant hazard, and the capital area will not be affected. Nevertheless, visitors to the eruption site are urged to exercise caution. The Meteorological Office states that gas levels near the eruption site can exceed safe levels, especially in low wind conditions when gas can accumulate in the valley. In such conditions, it is recommended to stay high on the slopes. When visiting the eruption, it is best to position oneself upwind of the eruption to avoid potentially dangerous exposure. Following the eruption, the magma has seen a relief of pressure, meaning a potential decrease in flow. Seismic activity has likewise decreased, with far fewer earthquakes detected than preceding the eruption.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
808,Iceland Review,Reykjanes Eruptions Impact Airport Relocation Plans,2022/08/04,"Seismic and volcanic activity on Southwest Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula affects the viability of building an airport at Hvassahraun, halfway between Reykjavík and Keflavík International Airport, Iceland’s Prime Minister told RÚV. Hvassahraun was previously selected as the most viable site for relocating Reykjavík City Airport, which is currently located near the city centre. Iceland’s Transport Minister stated yesterday there are diminishing chances an airport will be built at Hvassahraun. An eruption began yesterday afternoon on the Reykjanes peninsula, near Fagradalsfjall, where another eruption occurred just last year. Prior to these two eruptions, no eruptions had occurred on the peninsula for nearly 800 years. Both eruptions were preceded by strong earthquakes. Experts have stated that the Reykjanes peninsula is entering a volcanically active phase, which could mean regular eruptions over the coming decades – or even centuries. Both the Prime Minister and Transport Minister have stated this activity is a consideration when planning the construction of infrastructure such as airports. Last year’s Fagradalsfjall eruption was relatively small and did not cause any damage to roads or infrastructure. The same is true of the ongoing eruption so far. “As it stands, the eruption is in a relatively favourable location,” Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir stated. At the current rate of flow, it will take a significant amount of time for the lava to fill Meradalir valley and flow outward to other areas. Authorities have been discussing relocating Reykjavík City Airport for decades, and a task force had previously chosen Hvassahraun as the most viable location. This fall, preliminary results are expected from a working group that is evaluating the feasibility of Hvassahraun for a new airport. The group has mapped the impact of possible eruptions on roads, transport and energy infrastructure, and air transport. “I think that even if one is not a geologist or expert, it is quite clear from the way people have talked about it that we need to prepare for a new reality and that we are going to see earthquakes, or seismic activity or something like that, for a longer period of time [on Reykjanes], and that simply reduces the likelihood that development in this area is considered likely,” Transport Minister Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson told Vísir yesterday, shortly before magma broke through the earth’s surface on Reykjanes. Asked whether Reykjavík City Airport would remain in its current location for the long term, the Transport Minister pointed out that, in any case, it would take 15-20 years to build an alternate airport at Hvassahraun or elsewhere. Borgarnes, West Iceland, and Selfoss, South Iceland, have both been discussed as potential locations for international airports. Sigurður Ingi stated those sites could be considered in the future.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
809,Iceland Review,Eruption in Meradalir: Everything We Know So Far,2022/08/04,"Yesterday, August 3, an eruption began in Meradalir, near the site of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption. The magma flow is said to be at least five times larger than that of last year’s eruption, although it is still considered a relatively minor eruption. The location of the eruption is especially favourable, as it is unlikely to affect infrastructure such as roads. The original fissure was recorded as 260m long, but has since shrunk to some 130m. This is common for such fissure eruptions, which tend to isolate around one or two craters. The above picture from the Meteorological Office of Iceland shows a model of the most likely lava flow. While the model is an older one and was generated before the current eruption, it assumes a fissure in the same areas that are now active. As of now, the eruption and model conform to each other well, and it seems likely that the lava flow will follow the predicted path, away from important infrastructure. The Meteorological Office is currently at work generating a new, updated model. Einar Hjörleifson, natural scientist at the Meteorological Office, has indicated that the eruption has very little ash, and as such does not pose any danger to air traffic. The prevailing northerly wind is also blowing most of the volcanic gas south towards the ocean. However, visitors to the site are still advised to use caution and not approach the lava, as the fumes can prove dangers in high concentration and over a long time. Einar also stated that although we cannot know for certain, the earthquakes are likely to abate during the eruption as pressure is relieved. So far, the eruption is behaving similarly to the Fagradalsfjall eruption of last year, and there is reason to believe it will continue doing so. As of today, August 4, there has already been a reduction in seismic activity by half, with the largest earthquake in the last 24 hours registered at M3.4. As of now, the government has asked the public to avoid the area. Traffic to the eruption was originally closed as the situation was assessed, but people are currently not being turned away. However, there have already been search and rescue calls to the eruption site due to hikers sustaining injuries. The walk to the eruption site is a difficult one, at 17km [10.6mi] round trip. As always in Iceland, proper equipment and footwear are key, and visitors are advised to inform themselves of the conditions before setting out. The Reykjanes peninsula is a very geologically active area. More can be read about it here.  ",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
810,Iceland Review,Two Injured at Eruption Site,2022/08/04,"Two people were injured while visiting the eruption that began on Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula yesterday. One broke an ankle and had to be transported to hospital by a Coast Guard helicopter. Several others visiting the site required assistance due to minor injuries. It’s likely that thousands visited the eruption yesterday, according to RÚV, despite authorities’ warnings that the hike is long and not for those who are inexperienced or unprepared. The eruption is located in Meradalir valley, further inland from the Fagradalsfjall eruption that occurred on the Reykjanes peninsula last year. The hike to the site is around 17 kilometres [10.6 miles] long and includes considerable elevation. Suðurnes Police Commissioner Úlfar Lúðvíksson reminds the public that the hike is difficult and not for everyone. He told RÚV that many visiting the eruption last night were not carrying flashlights, though it has begun to get dark in the evenings. Off-road driving is banned at the site, as everywhere else in Iceland. Several individuals were fined for off-road driving near the eruption yesterday. Those who do visit the eruption need to be particularly aware of the risk of gas poisoning. Authorities advise visitors to avoid bringing children, who are more sensitive to toxic gases and more prone to poisoning, as heavy toxic gases collect closer to the ground. The same is true of pets such as dogs. Calm weather is forecast at the site later today, meaning that gas will likely collect in low-lying areas. Gas measuring equipment will be installed at the eruption site tomorrow.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

812,Iceland Review,BREAKING: Eruption Has Begun on Reykjanes,2022/08/03,"An eruption has begun on the Reykjanes peninsula, Southwest Iceland. Icelandic Met Office staff first became aware of the eruption around 1:30 PM today. Magma is spewing out of several-hundred-metre-long fissure at the location, and considerable gas is rising from the site. The active fissure is located at Fagradalsfjall, in a lava field created by last year’s eruption in the same location. Gases from the eruption are visible from the capital area, rising from behind Keilir mountain. Strong earthquakes, including several over M5, had shaken Southwest Iceland in recent days. The activity was reminiscent to that which occurred preceding last year’s eruption. Yesterday, a notice from the Icelandic Met Office stated that an eruption was likely in the coming days or weeks – that estimation has now been proved correct. The eruption can be watched in a live feed from mbl.is below.  The Civil Protection Department has raised its preparedness phase from the uncertainty phase to emergency phase. This means that immediate measures are being taken to ensure the safety and security of those in the eruption area. The eruption is currently small and is located a considerable distance from inhabited areas and infrastructure, in Meradalir valley. Volcanology Professor Þorvaldur Þórðarson told RÚV that at the current flow rate, it would take a considerable amount of time for lava to fill the valley and begin flowing out to other areas. It is possible other fissures or craters will open in the eruption. The eruption poses no danger to flights in and out of Keflavík International Airport at this time. Crews are now in the process of determining whether the area needs to be evacuated. Anyone at the eruption site is advised to remain upwind of the gas emerging from the site in order to avoid gas poisoning.

813,Iceland Review,Considerable Chances of Eruption in Coming Days or Weeks,2022/08/03,"Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula could be preparing another eruption less than a year since its last one ended. Magma is collecting in an intrusion only one kilometre below the earth’s surface beneath Fagradalsfjall, the site of last year’s eruption. A notice from the Icelandic Met Office states the chances of an eruption have increased and are now considerable. Strong earthquakes have been shaking the southwest region for days, leading authorities to declare a state of uncertainty for the area. However, the earthquakes have calmed over the last day or so, which may be a precursor to an eruption, if last year’s is any indication. “Preliminary deformation modelling results suggest the top depth of the new dike intrusion beneath Fagradalsfjall is very shallow – about 1 km,” the notice from Met Office reads. “The magma inflow rate is rapid, almost double that observed during the first dike intrusion in february-march 2021. There are indications that the deformation and seismicity is declining and this was precursory to the eruption which started on 19th March 2021. Considering all of the above, the likelihood of an eruption at Fagradalsfjall within the coming days is considered to be substantial.” If the ongoing activity leads to an eruption, Geophysicist Freysteinn Sigmundsson told RÚV it may be more powerful than last year’s Fagradalsfjall eruption, as the rate of inflow into the magma intrusion is much higher than with last year’s. “Because the flow is greater, there could be more force in this eruption, but the nature of the eruption would most likely be the same,” Freysteinn explained. “An effusive eruption with craters, and that the flow would be limited to certain craters.” If the flow is greater, that could mean more lava on the surface, more gas, and even a little bit of ash, Freysteinn explained. Last year’s eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula did not produce ash or gas in amounts that caused significant safety or travel issues. Read more about last year’s eruption on Reykjanes. The Civil Protection Department held a briefing yesterday for authorities, Met Office staff, and members of the scientific community to review the ongoing activity on Reykjanes. They emphasised that response crews are prepared to respond should an eruption occur.

815,Iceland Review,Southwest Iceland Experiences String of Earthquakes Overnight,2022/08/02,"Residents of Southwest Iceland, including the capital area, experienced a series of strong earthquakes last night, August 1, according to the Meteorological Office of Iceland. The largest registered earthquake was 5.4 magnitude, which occurred around 5:48pm yesterday evening near Grindavík. In total, some 15 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or greater have occurred since Saturday. The recent series of quakes have their origins near Kleifarvatn, a lake and popular nature area in the Reykjanes peninsula. The recent increase in seismological activity has led to a declaration of a State of Uncertainty in the event that the Fagradalsfjall eruption becomes active again, as similar conditions were observed before the eruptions of 2021. The recent earthquakes are attributed to magma intrusion, which is in line with the pattern from last year, where a series of earthquakes preceded the eruption. However, according to the Meteorological Office, the magma intrusion is small than last year’s. As of yet, hiking trails remain open in the area, and the Civil Defense has not closed off the area. No significant damage was caused by the recent quakes, but Mayor of Grindavík, Fannar Jónasson, said to RÚV that some damage was caused to a water pipe, which has since been repaired. Fannar stated that although the earthquakes may be uncomfortable, he believes that everyone is well prepared and that all agencies and businesses in the town have emergency plans.

816,Iceland Review,‘There are Direct Connections with Human Development’: Stickleback Conference Sheds Light on Human Genetics,2022/07/31,"The 10th International Conference on Stickleback Behaviour and Evolution was held at the University of Hólar in North Iceland this week. RÚV reports that the stickleback is one of the most researched fish in the world and has led to significant advances in the fields of both ethology, the science of animal behaviour, and genetics. Research on stickleback behaviour laid the foundation for modern behavioural science, even earning Dutch biologist Niko Tinbergen a Nobel Prize in 1973. The Stickleback Conference made its triumphant return after a long hiatus due to COVID-19. The last conference took place in Kyoto, Japan, in 2018. The turnout was good for this year’s five-day event at Hólar: 70 scientists from around the world gathered to share their research. Professor Bjarni Kristofer Kristjánsson said those gathered only scratched the surface of what they could potentially discuss when it comes to the small, but fascinating fish. “The stickleback is one of the most researched fish in the world, and there are many reasons for that,” he said. “Essentially, people in behavioural studies have been really interested in them. They’ve got interesting reproductive behaviour. The male fish dances before spawning and builds a nest and becomes really colourful and manifests really strong behavioural patterns.” Sticklebacks are also ideal research subjects because they are easy to raise in tanks and selectively breed, which is very useful when conducting experiments. “[The stickleback] has opened up a number of avenues [for us] to try and understand,” said Bjarni. “Like the development and evolution of vertebrates. We are vertebrates, of course, so there are direct connections with human development.” Bjarni says that sticklebacks are central to a wide range of diverse research, which is part of why the conference is so much fun. “You might hear lectures from ecologists or parasitologists. Then there’ll be some lectures about the genome and the development of the Y chromosome.” Indeed, the conference schedule was quite varied including talks on paternal care in threespine sticklebacks, developmental plasticity in eco-evolutionary population dynamics, “evolutionary ménage a trois,” personality-dependent colonization success, Molecular mechanisms of adaptation to freshwater, biological memory of climate variability and extreme events, foraging niche and diet variation, positive selection throughout regulatory elements on the threespine stickleback Y chromosome, “a stickleback approach to human genetic evolution,” and much more.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
817,Iceland Review,Uncertainty Phase Declared as Earthquakes Rock Reykjanes Peninsula,2022/07/30,"An Uncertainty Phase was declared on Reykjanes after earthquakes started rocking the peninsula around noon on Saturday, RÚV reports. As of 3:00 PM, the earthquakes were still underway. The most significant seismic activity is concentrated to the northeast of Mt. Fagradalsfjall. At time of writing, small quakes were happening on a more or less constant basis; nearly 700 had been measured as of 5:30 PM. However, a much larger quake, measuring 4.0, occurred earlier in the day, around 2:00 PM, and that one was felt not only around Reykjanes, but also throughout the capital area as well as the villages of Akranes (roughly 95 km [59 mi] to the northwest) and Hvolsvöllur (about 120 km [75 mi] to the southeast). An even bigger earthquake occurred  3 km northeast of Fagradalsfjall at 4:00 PM, this time at a magnitude of 4.4. Einar Hjörleifsson, an expert in natural hazards at the Met, said that the first large earthquake occurred at a depth of 5-7 km [3-4 mi]. He said the increasing magnitude of the eruptions may indicate that some significant seismic event is afoot; the activity may be a precursor to another volcanic eruption. Einar noted that the seismic activity currently underway on Reykjanes is reminiscent of that which occurred in the area around the end of last year. But in that instance, there was no eruption, as the lava did not rise to the surface. Later in the day, Sigríður Kristjánsdóttir, who is also a natural hazards expert, said the Met believed there was lateral magma movement occurring at a depth of 5-7 km. The Met was paying close attention to any change in depth of the seismic activity, particularly if it were to get any more shallow, “as that would be an indication that the magma is pushing its way a bit higher.” See Also: 50% Chance of Another Reykjanes Eruption this Year, Expert Says An Uncertainty Phase means that there will be additional monitoring of the Reykjanes peninsula and any developments in seismic activity there. An Uncertainty Phase is not indicative of a current state of emergency, but signifies that if conditions continue to progress, there could be danger to the safety of people, inhabited areas, or the environment. During an Uncertainty Phase, first responders and emergency services such as the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Management review their preparedness plans and get ready to put them into action if needed. The Met has also issued a yellow aviation weather alert and noted that falling rocks and landslides could easily begin on steep terrain. Travellers are advised to be careful on mountain roadways and in areas surrounded by sheer hills. Peninsula residents were directed to take precautions with furniture and household items that can fall during an earthquake and take special care to ensure that no loose objects can fall on people who are sleeping.

818,Iceland Review,Grain Farmer Fights Off Swan Invasion with Falcon-Shaped Kites,2022/07/29,"A farmer in South Iceland is resorting to a unique method to combat a unique threat to his grain crops. RÚV reports that Björgvín Þór Harðarson, a pig and grain farmer in Laxárdalur, is using falcon-shaped kites to scare away the whooper swans that are consuming and causing significant damage to his crops. Swans are a major threat to grain crops in Iceland but are generally unfazed by farmers’ attempts to ward them off. Björgvín Þór said the birds are definitely the most difficult pests for him to deal with on the farm—and probably the most prolific. When the swans’ numbers are at their peak, he may find as many as 500 swans occupying his fields. ‘When they arrive, it’s just total destruction’ “When they arrive, it’s just total destruction,” he lamented. “If they arrive in a fully mature field in the fall, they’ll walk all over it and eat it and trample all the straw and everything.” Björgvín Þór has tried many deterrents—including scarecrows and acoustic warning devices, or pingers—but to no avail. “I was fighting with this swan that was attacking both my barley in the fall and wheat in the spring,” he explained. “Then I tried one of these kites that I’d been told about, and it worked like a charm.” Kites mimic the flight of birds of prey The kites that Björgvín Þór uses are shaped like falcons and designed to glide in a pattern that mimics the flight of birds of prey. They are used widely within the wine industry as an environmentally friendly and effective form of “bird abatement.” They can also be used on fish farms and to drive away unwanted gulls and crows in urban areas, among other uses. But as well as the kites work, Björgvín Þór is still careful to use them only sparingly so the swans will not grow accustomed to them or eventually see through the ruse. He first used the kites in the spring when his wheat crops were growing but has now taken them down because there’s no need at the moment. He’ll fly them again in the fall, during the harvest, and hopes they’ll be enough to keep his voracious whooper nemeses at bay.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
819,Iceland Review,Dolphin Species Never Before Seen in Iceland Beaches in Northwest,2022/07/28,"Two dolphins of a species never before seen in Iceland washed ashore in Hrútafjörður in Northwest Iceland last week. RÚV reports that the carcasses of both mammals were collected yesterday by a biologist at the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute, who says it is not unlikely that the animals were drawn north by warming seas. One of the dolphins was already dead when it washed ashore. The other beached itself trying to follow its companion. The second dolphin was not going to survive and so was euthanized under the advisement of a veterinarian just before the weekend. The dolphins were both Risso’s dolphins, sometimes called gray dolphins. Their remains were collected by biologist Sverrir Daníel Halldórsson, who will conduct autopsies on both. Sverrir Daníel says he’s found no evidence that Risso’s dolphins have ever been observed around Iceland before, although they have been seen around the Faroe Islands. “It’s a warm-water species,” he explained. “They’re found a bit to the east of Ireland and Northwest Scotland. But the largest number is found further south, in warmer seas.” Sverrir Daníel thinks the dolphins were most likely drawn out of their natural habitat and so far to the north by warmer currents. Both animals appeared quite emaciated, he said. “It could be that they wandered off course and couldn’t find any food.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
820,Iceland Review,Bacterial Infection Brucella Canis Suspected in Dogs in Iceland,2022/07/27,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) has reason to suspect that a bacterial disease called Brucella canis has been found in dogs in Iceland. RÚV reports that Bruncella canis can—in very rare instances—be transmitted from dogs to humans, with young children, pregnant, and immunocompromised people at the greatest risk of serious infection. This is the first time that Brucella canis has been detected in Iceland. MAST veterinarian Vigdís Tryggvadóttir was quick to clarify that as yet, it is not certain that Bruncella canis actually is in Iceland, although there is a very high likeliness of this. “We have a strong suspicion, but it’s still only a suspicion,” she said. “We’ve sent samples abroad for confirmation, and hopefully, it won’t be [Brucella canis]. But [results] could take up to two weeks.” In the meantime, MAST has enacted some protocols to curb the spread of infection. Relevant parties have been told to quarantine animals suspected of being infected with Brucella canis and a mating ban has been instated where appropriate. The agency is also collecting samples and information to trace possible spread and is urging dog breeders to observe the strictest level of infection prevention while assisting with whelping. Breeders are also encouraged to contact their veterinarian if a dog miscarries late in gestation or gives birth to stillborn puppies or puppies that die shortly after birth. Dog breeders and vets at highest risk of exposure, minimal risk for others Brucella canis is a zoonotic bacterial disease, which means it can be passed from animals to people. In a recent announcement, MAST said its most prominent symptoms in female dogs are miscarriages late in gestation, as well as puppies that are stillborn or die soon after birth; for male dogs, swollen testicles. The most common mode of transmission between dogs is mating. It is rare for people to become infected with Brucella canis, but the biggest risk of infection is via fluids and tissue when helping an infected dog give birth. This puts dog breeders and veterinarians at the highest risk of infection, says Vigdís, while nearly everyone else has almost no risk of exposure. In the very unlikely case of infection, symptoms of Brucella canis within people include fever, chills, malaise, loss of appetite, bone and/or muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms may appear within several days or as much as a month after infection. The disease is not generally transmittable between people. First time suspected in Iceland This is the first time that Brucella canis has been suspected of being in Iceland, but it is a very common disease in nearby nations. “Brucella canis is endemic in many countries in Europe and also Asia and further afield,” said Vigdís. “It’s never been diagnosed here and it’s rare in some other European countries. We’ve never had it here and want, of course, to keep it outside our borders.” Vigdís concluded by saying that even if a case of Brucella canis is confirmed in Iceland, that doesn’t mean an epidemic is breaking out.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0

822,Iceland Review,Rescued Seal Pup Recovering in Reykjavík,2022/07/21,"A seal pup that was hardly alive when it was found in Reykjavík harbour earlier this week is recovering well at Reykjavík Zoo, RÚV reports. Reykjavík Animal Services are treating the pup and plan to release it back into the wild. “It was in really bad condition. It was exhausted and hungry. It didn’t come to until I bent over it,” said Veigar Friðgeirsson, a Reykjavík Animal Services staff member. Asked what caused the seal pup’s poor condition, Veigar stated: “What is most likely is that its mother simply stopped breastfeeding it and giving it food. The proportion of young seals that die in this way is actually fairly high.” Veigar says the seal pup is recovering well. “We started by pumping water into it, and vitamins. It responded well to that. Now, in consultation with a veterinarian, it gets a fish shake four to five times a day. Then we’re going to try to give it a whole fish soon. I’m very optimistic.” The rescued seal pup’s sex is not known, but it will be named Veiga or Veigar after its caretaker, who expects it to make a full recovery. “We want wild animals to live in the wild, so we’ll try to return it to the sea if that’s possible,” he stated.","Nature,Society",0,0,1,0,1,0
823,Iceland Review,Feeding Habits of Westman Islands’ Mysterious Nocturnal Birds Tracked,2022/07/18,"GPS trackers weighing just 0.95 grammes will help scientists track the movements of three species of elusive nocturnal birds that stay in the Westman Islands, South Iceland, for a part of each year, RÚV reports. The three species are the manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), Leach’s petrel (Oceanodroma leucorrhoa), and the storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), all of which winter in the southern hemisphere – on both sides of the Atlantic. “This has never been done in Iceland before, and we are in fact mapping the feeding areas of these species,” explained Erpur Snær Hansen, director of the South Iceland Nature Research Centre. Results from the miniscule trackers placed on Leach’s petrels and manx shearwaters have already begun to arrive, while data from the storm petrels are expected to arrive later this summer. The three species are related and are all nocturnal. “They only come ashore to the outlying Westman Islands at night, so they are rarely seen anywhere else,” Erpur stated. He compared the petrels’ flight to that of bats, saying they were “mysterious in many ways.” The GPS trackers have revealed that the Leach’s petrels in the Westman Islands feed to the west of the archipelago, at the edge of the continental shelf. However, data shows that individuals sometimes travel much farther. “One of them decided to go all the way to Rockall, which is 600 kilometres [373 miles] to the south, and they go quite far,” Erpur remarked. “They go to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where the big whales are, so they go south and across a very large area.”   Placing the minuscule trackers on the birds is not easy. “It’s a bit of a hassle because they live underground, and we need to find them and get them out,” Erpur explained. “We play their call and they answer us and then we know where they live, but it’s another challenge altogether to get in there, grab them, and put the equipment on.” The GPS devices do not include transmitters, so the birds must be retrieved in order to read the data. The Leach’s petrels that summer in Iceland winter in both Namibia and Brazil. Manx shearwaters winter in Argentina. Erpur says the species are not numerous and the number of Leach’s petrels in the Atlantic has decreased. The data is expected to help evaluate how the birds are doing, as well as compare the two petrel species.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
824,Iceland Review,Collapse of Midge Population Impacts Mývatn Birdlife,2022/07/16,"The ubiquitous midge is almost completely absent from Mývatn, the pointedly named ‘Midge Lake,’ this year. But while many people might celebrate the scarcity of the thick clouds of blackflies that generally characterize the region, RÚV reports that the population collapse, which happens on a cycle of six to nine years, will have a long-lasting impact on local birdlife. In a normal season, there are as many as 100,000 hatchlings around Mývatn, says Árni Einarsson, director of the Mývatn Research Station. But this year, there are just under 1,000. Midges are a vital food source for birds around the lake, but there are almost none now, Árni reports. As a direct result, “we’re not seeing any chicks on the lake,” he explained. “There are 20,000 pairs of ducks, but very few are raising any young. They’ve largely neglected their nests and stopped laying. Have abandoned their eggs, left them behind in the nests. And so those chicks that do hatch only live a few days.” Árni estimates that the midge population has decreased by ten thousandfold this year. The drastic drop in midges can be attributed to fluctuations in Mývatn wherein midges devour all their food sources at the bottom of the lake. “The food on the lake bed runs out and then the midge population collapses and then the fish come and finish off whatever remains of them […] and there are no midges left.” Árni says this happens every seven to nine years—it’s now been about eight since the last time the midge population collapsed. As a result, the bird population will be much smaller for the next two to three years. “This makes a dent in the stock,” he concluded. “It doesn’t renew itself.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
825,Iceland Review,Record Numbers of Pink Salmon Caught,2022/07/15,"Iceland’s Marine Research Institute has issued a report on salmon and trout catches in 2021. 339 pink salmon were reported, an all-time record. Pink salmon, also called humpback salmon for the prominent bump males develop during their spawn migration, is native to the Pacific ocean and is considered an invasive species in Iceland. Some 323 pink salmon were caught by anglers, and 16 were caught in nets. In total, 36,461 salmon catches were registered last year, with 53.7% of them released and 46.3% of them landed. The total catch is recorded as 46,832kg. In the second half of the 20th century, the fish was stocked in Russian streams. After this introduction, the pink salmon has made its way around the arctic region to the North Atlantic, and the species has been recorded not just in Iceland, but also throughout the UK and Ireland as an invasive species. Environmentalists are concerned that the fish may disrupt native habits and compete with other species for food.","Nature,Sport",0,0,1,0,0,1
826,Iceland Review,Rauðasandur Annual Beach Cleanup Complete,2022/07/14,"On Saturday, July 2, volunteers cleaned up the Rauðisandur beach for the seventh time, reports Iceland’s Environmental Agency. The annual cleanup takes place through the cooperation of the Environmental Agency, landowners, and the local municipalities. This year, 22 volunteers were on hand to help clear the beaches. Small debris is cleared off of the beach with bags, but larger items must be placed in piles to be taken away to containers for sorting. Notably, this year saw significantly less trash than previous years, perhaps due to the lull in tourism brought on by COVID. Part of the beach cleaning is carried out in accordance with OSPAR, an international agreement for environmental protection in the North-East Atlantic. This entails demarcating a 100m stretch of beach and then measuring and reporting all debris. This is done to better understand the ways in which pollution, such as plastic, accumulates in the ocean. Unlike other beaches in Iceland with black, volcanic sand, Rauðasandur, located in the West Fjords, is noteworthy for its red sands. This distinctive feature comes from scallops, which grow in particularly high density in Breiðafjörður.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
827,Iceland Review,Skeiðarárjökull Fastest Retreating Glacier of Last Year,2022/07/14,"In a newsletter from the Melting Glaciers project, Skeiðarárjökull was singled out as the fastest-retreating glacier last year, having lost some 400m of its eastern tail. In their 2021 overview of the state of Icelandic glaciers, the Meteorological Office of Iceland stated that glaciers in Iceland have been receding for at least a quarter of a century and that this pattern is one of the clearest forms of evidence for climate change in Iceland. The only significant exception to this trend was in 2015, when Icelandic glaciers were either in equilibrium, or even experienced slight growth. Since 1995, Icelandic glaciers are estimated to have lost a total of 8% of their total volume. Breiðamerkurjökull, the glacier that terminates in the popular tourist attraction Jökulsárlón, also experienced significant loss last year, shrinking around 150m. Melting Glaciers is a cooperative project between the Icelandic Meteorological Office, Vatnajökull National Park, the Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Climate, the University of Iceland’s Institute of Earth Sciences Glaciology Group, and the Southeast Iceland Natural History Museum.","Nature,Sci&Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0
828,Iceland Review,Jogger Has Run-In with Aggro Owl in Southeast Iceland,2022/07/10,"“Tempo running” took on a new meaning for Þórgunnur Torfadóttir when she went out for a jog in Hornafjörður, Southeast Iceland last week and was dive bombed—repeatedly—by a short-eared owl (Asio flammeus). Fréttablaðið reports that the fearless flyer was most likely protecting its young, but a local ornithologist says that such behaviour is relatively uncommon among owls in Iceland. “I was out for a jog and just starting a short tempo run—I wanted to push myself,” Þórgunnur recalled. “Then a bird flies toward me and I think: That gull is flying really low.” ‘I see a shadow coming up behind me’  As the bird got closer, it started hissing and spitting, Þórgunnur continued. “That’s when I see it’s not a gull, but an owl. And then she dived at me over and over with such horrible screeching.” In one terrifying instance, the owl’s razor-sharp talons were only about a metre [3 ft] from her face. Þórgunnur steeled herself and did the only sensible thing: she hissed and screeched back at the owl while vigorously flapping her arms. The spectacle worked and the bird retreated. Turning and running back in the other direction, Þórgunnur thought her ordeal was over. “But then I see a shadow coming up behind me and think: No, not you again! I ran as fast as I could and was finally able to shake her.” Þórgunnur said she knew that skua, Arctic terns, sea gulls, and even redwings are known to take a flying peck at people who intrude on their territory, but the incident with the owl still surprised her. “I had my hair in a ponytail, and it occurred to me that maybe the owl thought it was a mouse or a fox’s tail or something.” But more likely, she said, is simply that it’s the owl’s nesting season. Still loves birds Ornithologist Björn Arnarson at the Southeast Iceland Bird Observatory confirms the latter speculation. He said this kind of behaviour isn’t common among owls in Iceland, but it does occasionally happen at this time of year. The owl was almost certainly protecting its young nearby. He explained that short-eared owls are very protective of their owlets, but agreed that this particular bird was unusually aggressive. As harrowing as the experience was, Þórgunnur says she still wouldn’t rank it in the top ten worst of her life and moreover, wouldn’t even say that the short-eared owl is the worst of the dive-bombing birds she’s fended off. “The skua are the worst,” she said. “They crash into you like fighter jets, but they don’t make as much noise as owls.” And none of her run-ins with feathered fighters change the affection she holds for southeast Iceland, which she said is a bird paradise, and its fauna. “Adventures like this don’t change the fact that I still really enjoy birds.”",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
829,Iceland Review,Road and Coastal Administration Work All Night to Prevent Route One from Flooding,2022/07/09,"Employees of the Road and Coastal Administration worked through the night to ensure that rising water levels in the Djúpadalsá river Skagafjörður, North Iceland would not flood Route One (the Ring Road). RÚV reports that breakwaters along a five-kilometre stretch of the road have been damaged. Skagafjörður has received a great deal of rain in recent days and all the rivers in the area are rising. Road and Coastal workers used bulldozers to try and reinforce breakwaters that were at risk due to rising waters and contain the Djúpadalsá river. Route One also needed fortification, said Stefán Öxndal Reynisson, an inspector with the Road and Coastal Administration in Sauðárkrókur. “These breakwaters are really damaged for probably close to five kilometres and the only channel leading into the Djúpadalsá river is now just overflowing with stuff after we’d gotten it in pretty good shape when we dredged it for three or four years.” The extent of the damage has yet to be determined, but it’s estimated that it will cost tens of millions of krónur to rebuild the breakwaters that have been destroyed. Unusual for many rivers to flood at once Stefán says that usually, only one river floods at once. “But it was just all the rivers yesterday evening and overnight. It didn’t help that the Héraðsvötn river was also full and there was a bit of a bottleneck into the Djúpadalsá river as well.” There’s still a great deal of water in the rivers, all of which are churning dark and muddy. It’s expected that the Road and Coastal Administration will need to spend a great deal of time reshaping the channel of the Djúpadalsá river so that it will be able to accommodate the next flood. But for now, the sole focus is on keeping the river under control until conditions improve. “It’s a little colder now, so I’m hopeful that the water level in the river will go down so that we can see what we’ve really got to do here,” said Stefán.",Nature,0,0,1,0,0,0
830,Iceland Review,"Ukraine War: Humanitarian Aid to Be Increased Next Year, PM Says",2022/10/11,"Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has told RÚV that the government will increase its expenditure on humanitarian aid next year as a result of the war in Ukraine. Katrín has condemned Russia’s invasion and recent missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. After Russian President Vladimir Putin launched missile strikes on several Ukrainian cities on Monday – in response to Saturday’s attack on a bridge linking Russia with occupied Crimea – political leaders in the west have expressed their condemnation. At least 11 people have reportedly been killed and scores more have been injured, the Guardian reports. Following news of this attack, Ukrainians in Iceland congregated in front of the Russian embassy in Reykjavík to protest. The protest’s organiser stated that “it was like the war was beginning again.” Speaking to RÚV this afternoon, PM Katrín Jakobsdóttir observed that the war in Ukraine was obviously escalating. “We’re seeing threats of nuclear attacks, which is, of course, entirely unacceptable; we’re seeing attacks on civilians, which is, of course, also completely unacceptable. The war is intensifying.” When asked how the government would respond to this escalation, Katrín began by saying that her cabinet had always been vocal in its condemnation of Russia’s illegal invasion on the global political stage. “We’ve also contributed through humanitarian aid – and will continue to do so. We’re drafting plans for next year, as we don’t foresee the conflict coming to an end,” Katrín remarked. It is unclear at this time how much the government will earmark for humanitarian aid next year; according to the government’s website, Iceland has thus far contributed ISK 1 billion of humanitarian aid to the war in Ukraine. In addition to humanitarian aid, Katrín added that Iceland has offered assistance in the form of training, with regard to the location and disposal of explosive devices, in addition to participating in other comparable projects directly related to the conflict.

831,Iceland Review,Hopes for New ASÍ Leadership Amidst Contract Negotiations,2022/10/06,"With many labour contracts expiring at the end of October, pressure is mounting on the current round of negotiations. Kristján Þórður Snæbjarnarson, acting chairman of ASÍ after Drífa Snædal’s resignation earlier this year, has stated that a major issue at ASÍ’s upcoming conference will of course be wage increases, but that choosing new leadership will play an equally important role. Drífa’s departure earlier this year caused some turmoil within ASÍ leadership, which Kristján states has unfortunately turned the energies of the association towards inward power struggles, not outward to the wage negotiations. So far, VR president Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson is the only one to announce their candidacy for ASÍ president, but there still remains the opportunity for individuals to announce their candidacy at the conference. Another debated issue in the current negotiations is the role of the state mediator. Kristján is on record calling for a simplified process by which unions can call for strikes, giving them relatively more power at the bargaining table. Notably, many other trade unions in the Nordic nations also allow for leadership to call unilaterally for a strike, circumventing the need for union-wide votes. Kristján has called for such reforms to the strike process in lieu of strengthening the role of the state mediator. The wage negotiations take place against the backdrop of an ever-rising cost of living in Iceland. Main contributing factors include inflation and rising interest rates that have seen mortgage payments increase significantly this year. Yesterday, the Central Bank announced a .25% increase to the interest rate. Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the Central Bank, warned that the course of inflation in Iceland was largely up to the labour market. The rate increase could be interpreted as an attempt to dissuade negotiators from too-ambitious of wage increases, as they may drive inflation further.  ","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0

Last Friday, Vladimir Putin declared the absorption of four Ukrainian regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – after results from referendums “showed” that more than 95% of voters wanted to join Russia. “An absurd level of support,” a journalist from the Washington Post writes.

833,Iceland Review,139 Fin Whales Hunted During Whaling Season,2022/09/30,"Five fin whales were hunted this week and towed into Hvalfjörður fjord. A total of 139 whales were caught this whaling season by the company Hvalur hf, Mbl.is reports. As reported by Iceland Review earlier this year, two whaling ships owned by the company Hvalur hf. set off from Reykjavík harbour on June 22 this summer to begin the whaling season. No commercial whaling had taken place in Iceland for four years (although a single minke whale was hunted in 2021.) By the start of September, 100 fin whales had been caught. Four weeks later, after a spell of fine weather, 39 additional whales had been hunted – with five of those being towed into Hvalfjörður fjord this week. “What’s noteworthy this time around,” Elín B. Ragnarsdóttir, Division Head of Fishing Supervision with the Directorate of Fisheries, told Mbl.is, “is that inspectors from the Directorate of Fisheries have been aboard all whaling ships since August 24 and have supervised the hunting of fin whales on behalf of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST). Until August 24, inspectors were on board the whaling ships and supervised the hunting of about 15% of the whales.” When asked if any complaints had been filed on behalf of the Directorate of Fisheries, Elín gestured towards MAST: “The supervision that is carried out today is largely in the hands of the Food and Veterinary Authority, given that animal-welfare issues fall within their purview. A summary of the Directorate of Fisheries’ supervision is being prepared but is not ready for publication.” Whaling season usually concludes at the end of September (although it depends on the weather). Earlier this year, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated she saw little reason to permit whaling after Hvalur hf.’s current licence expires in 2023. In an op-ed published in the Morgunblaðið newspaper, Svandís wrote that there was little evidence that whaling was economically beneficial to Iceland. She also noted that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. The minister concluded by saying that the government would carry out an assessment on the potential economic and social impact of whaling this year.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
834,Iceland Review,Bill to Ban Oil Exploration to Be Resubmitted,2022/09/29,"Minister of the Environment Guðlaugur Þór Guðlaugsson has announced that he will resubmit a bill to Parliament banning oil exploration within Iceland’s exclusive economic zone, RÚV reports. The ban is “fully consistent with the government’s climate policy,” says the minister. Last spring, Minister of the Environment Guðlaugur Þór Guðlaugsson submitted a bill to Parliament banning oil exploration within Iceland’s exclusive economic zone. The bill was in line with the ruling parties’ government agreement, which stipulated that the authorities would not grant any oil-exploration licences (while also setting a few climate-related goals, among them Iceland becoming carbon-neutral by 2040). Although the bill was not voted on prior to Parliament’s summer hiatus, the minister has now announced his intention of resubmitting the bill this fall, RÚV reports. The ban will not only extend to oil exploration within Iceland’s exclusive economic zone but will also ban all research and oil and gas processing in the area. The bill implies revisions to several Icelandic laws. When asked by RÚV whether eliminating this option during the energy crisis in Europe was wise, the minister responded thusly: “This option would not solve our current problems. Any benefit from oil exploration would not be felt in a matter of years – but decades. We do, however, need energy, and we’ve got it. We know how to generate energy, by which I’m referring to geothermal heat, hydroelectric power, and other alternatives.” As noted by RÚV, the history of oil exploration in Iceland is relatively brief, having mostly been focused on the so-called “Dragon Zone” to the northeast of Iceland. The first oil-exploration licences were granted in 2012. Three companies were granted licences, all three of which have since relinquished them (the last of which in 2018). The minister clarified that any criticism of the bill, which was “perfectly natural,” stemmed mainly from the observation that Europe, and the world at large, was facing an energy crisis – but that that energy was needed quickly. “Those countries with which we like to compare ourselves – not just because of climate change but also because they’re trying not to rely on Russia – are trying to find [cleaner solutions fast], which is why our focus is, first and foremost, on green Icelandic energy.” Earlier this month, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir addressed the bill during her keynote speech before Parliament, observing that Iceland was in a “prime position” to transition to greener sources of energy for the sake of public and planetary good, by ensuring, among other things, that energy companies owned by the Icelandic government would not be sold. “A bill will be submitted that will ban oil exploration in Iceland’s exclusive economic zone. It’s important that this bill be passed for it offers a clear message to the world: Iceland intends to do its part when it comes to the greatest challenge of our time; we are driving full-speed ahead out of the carbon economy – and into a new, green economy,” Katrín stated.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
835,Iceland Review,Iceland: Terrorist Plot Sparks Debate on Police Power,2022/09/23,"Icelandic police arrested four men in their twenties this week who are suspected of plotting a terrorist attack on state institutions, possibly including the Icelandic parliament and police force. While the police managed to arrest the men before they could carry out their alleged plan, the incident has sparked a debate on whether the Icelandic police force is adequately equipped for responding to such incidents, and whether the legal framework they operate in is adequate. Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson stated he collaborating with the National Police Commissioner to draft suggestions for reform within the police force. “We are considering publishing these suggestions this autumn,” Jón told Fréttablaðið. “The state of organised crime is more serious than people realise.” While Jón stated that increasing police weaponry could potentially be included in those suggestions, he added that does not mean arming ordinary law enforcement officers with firearms. Ordinary policemen in Iceland don’t carry guns on their person, although there is a gun stored in every police car. The special forces, which do carry firearms, are called out for incidents involving weapons, and their call-outs have increased in number recently. Read More: Does Iceland Have a Gun Problem? Fjölnir Sæmundsson, chairman of the National Association of Police Officers (Landssamband lögreglumanna) stated that while the incident shocked police officers, he is not of the opinion that it indicates a need to arm ordinary police officers in Iceland. The incident does, however, demonstrate the necessity of collaborating with police departments abroad and perhaps reviewing regulations on the permissions Icelandic police have to monitor certain individuals, according to Fjölnir. Asked whether Iceland, like other Nordic countries, is experiencing a rise in the activities of extremist alt-right groups, National Police Commissioner Sigríður Björk Guðjónsdóttir stated that the risk of crime connected to such groups is still considered low. Sigríður stated that the risk assessment for terrorist incidents would not be changed in light of this one incident. Recent incidents involving weapons in Iceland contain one commonality: those involved are young, Icelandic males. Professor of Criminology Helgi Gunnlaugsson told Iceland Review he believes this should be studied. “It’s important to look at the ideology. These young Icelandic males think carrying these weapons around is important and they are prepared to use them. We need to study what’s happening with young males that are on the margins of society.” Helgi suggested that within the Icelandic system, there is more emphasis on responding to crime instead of trying to prevent it. “You have the police, but it would also be helpful to have other types of agencies approaching troubled youth in a constructive way.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

In the press conference which took place at 3pm today, the police have stated it is safe to assume either parliament or the police themselves may have been targets. The police have so far not been forthcoming with details of the arrests. Stundin reports that the suspects are men in their twenties and were found to have hoarded a number of weapons, including dozens of semiautomatic guns and large amounts of ammunition. Nine houses are reported to have been searched. Semiautomatic weapons are considered especially deadly, as they can hold high-capacity magazines. According to Stundin, the suspects may be connected to other international organizations under investigation by the police. At the press conference, Chief Police Inspector Karl Steinar Valsson stated, “It’s safe to say that our society is safer than it was before.” He continued: “This is the first investigation of its kind to be launched in Iceland. Of course, we don’t want to reveal what the exact police response was. But at the height of the operation, 50 police personnel took part.” The case is still developing, but as Stundin notes, acts of terrorism can carry a maximum sentence of  life imprisonment in Iceland. In addition to violent terroristic acts, financing terrorism can carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, and inciting terroristic acts can carry a maximum sentence of 6 years.

837,Iceland Review,Reykjavík Preschool Staffing Shortage Leaves 90 Positions Unfilled,2022/09/21,"In the latest numbers from RÚV, around 90 positions need to be filled before Reykjavík preschools can be considered fully staffed. Approximately 500 children aged 12 months and older remain on waitlists in Reykjavík City alone. Hjördís Rut Sigurjónsdóttir, Information Office for the Department of Education and Recreation at City of Reykjavík, has stated that filling the vacant positions has so far gone more smoothly than expected, with around 95% of full-time vacancies filled. Nevertheless, many children still remain on waitlists throughout the city, with 478 children 12 months and older and 48 children 18 months and older still waiting on placements. Not limited to the capital region, all of Iceland is experiencing something of a preschool crisis at the moment. Due to recent population growth, however, the problem is most keenly felt in Reykjavík and surrounding settlements. Traditionally, municipalities have accepted children into the preschool system starting at 18 to 24 months. Recently, there has been a push in the City of Reykjavík to start accepting children already beginning at 12 months into the system, to bridge the gap between parental leave and the preschool system. While the 12 month target was a much-requested concession for working parents, the preschool system has had to cope with much higher numbers this year, leaving many children stuck on waitlists. In a statement to RÚV, Hjördís said: “Recruitment for the kindergartens is going beyond expectations and it is clear that the actions taken by the City of Reykjavík have yielded results, such as advertisements and a new application website.” Despite the progress made, many parents feel that not enough is being done to address the problem, with some having to resort to private daycares or else reduce their rate of employment to care for their children. This August, working parents staged a demonstration at Reykjavík City Hall, turning the building into a sit-in daycare. The protest was an attempt to force action from a City Hall that they saw as doing little to care for their children. So far, Reykjavík City has pledged to expand capacity through construction of new preschools and expansion of existing facilities. However, critics say the expansion of facilities cannot address the fundamental staffing shortage and that deeper changes in the education and remuneration of preschool teachers must be made.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
838,Iceland Review,Mail No Longer Delivered at Home in Proposed Change to Postal System,2022/09/20,"A draft bill has been published on the government’s consultation portal that proposes changes to the postal system, including a reduction in at-home mailbox delivery. Among other changes, the draft as it currently stands would introduce increased use of mailbox centres over home mailboxes. Originally used in rural areas in order to reduce cost of service, the postal service uses such centres  in order to make fewer stops and to centralize services in lower-population settlements. However, mailbox centres could become increasingly common in Iceland’s urban areas as well, requiring residents to pick up their mail at a separate location. In the introduction to the draft it states: “it is clear if we look at the future of postal services both in this country and, for example, in Norway, there will be more use of mailbox complexes in the future instead of deliveries to every house, even in larger urban areas. This has resulted in savings and a positive environmental impact.” All residents have the ability to submit reviews and suggestions for the draft until the deadline of October 2.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
839,Iceland Review,Icelandic Delegation Present at Royal Funeral,2022/09/20,"President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and his wife Eliza Reid were present yesterday for the royal funeral in Westminster Abbey. The royal funeral gathered together hundreds of world leaders, with much of London shut down to traffic for the funeral procession. The late Elizabeth II was laid to rest at 11:00am, Icelandic time. In an interview with RÚV, the President stated that it was a vey solemn occasion, with psalms, organ, choir, and many other musical accompaniments. “The whole ceremony was significant in every way,” he stated, “and historic as well.” The President continued: “She performed military service, took part in protecting her homeland in the Second World War, and departs us now in the year 2022. In this ceremony, times long gone met with the contemporary. Then we look forward and wonder to ourselves how the future will be. What we know is that Queen Elizabeth did her dues and performed her duties conscientiously and with respect for her country and subjects.” The British Embassy in Reykjavík was closed for the occasion, and many Icelanders also followed along from home. Some facilities even offered live screenings of the state funeral, such as the Hrafnista elder care home in Hafnafjörður, which held a ceremony for the residents.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
840,Iceland Review,Parliamentary Resolution Reignites EU Membership Debate,2022/09/18,"A parliamentary resolution that proposes a referendum be held to determine whether Iceland should continue membership negotiations with the European Union has the full support of every MP in the Social Democratic Alliance, Reform Party, and Pirate Party, but has been met with staunch opposition from members of the People’s Party, RÚV reports. See Also: Foreign Minister: Iceland’s EU Membership Off the Table (March 2015) On July 16, 2009, Alþingi passed a parliamentary resolution instructing the government to submit an application for Iceland’s membership in the EU, after which it was supposed to hold a referendum on the resulting membership agreement. In March 2015, however, then-Foreign Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson sent a letter to the European Union stating that Iceland was no longer interested in membership. See Also: Icelandic Government’s Letter to EU Gets a Reply (April 2015) Proponents of the current resolution say the 2009 resolution still stands and should be honoured. They submitted their resolution, proposing a referendum on continued EU membership negotiations, to Alþingi on Thursday. The undersigning MPs want a vote to be held on the issue before the end of 2023. In the event of such a referendum, Icelandic voters would be asked to vote yes or no on the following question: “Do you want Iceland to pick up negotiations with the European Union with the goal of developing a membership agreement that would be submitted to the nation for approval or rejection?” Says number of Icelanders opposed to EU membership has only grown since Brexit People’s Party chair Guðmundur Ingi Kristinsson pushed back against the resolution immediately, saying that the majority of the nation does not want Iceland to join the EU. He said that Iceland’s anti-EU contingent has only grown in the wake of Brexit. Within days of the new resolution’s submission, the People’s Party had submitted a resolution of their own, namely that Iceland should withdraw its application for membership to the EU entirely. The proponents of the counter-resolution are all People’s Party MPs. They have submitted the same resolution for the last three legislative sessions.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
841,Iceland Review,Icelandic President’s Coat of Arms Unveiled in Denmark,2022/09/16,"President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson was awarded the Order of the Elephant in 2017. In a ceremony at Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød last Monday, the president’s personal coat of arms was unveiled. President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson was awarded Denmark’s Order of the Elephant by the queen during a state visit in 2017. The Order of the Elephant is Denmark’s highest-ranked honour, which is almost exclusively awarded to royalty and heads of state today. For over 300 years, it has been customary for every knight of the order to have a personal coat of arms made by the royal heraldic painter, which is hung in the Knight’s Chapel at Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød. On Monday, Guðni’s escutcheon was unveiled and hung in a ceremony attended by the president and First Lady Eliza Reid. As noted on the website of the royal house, the coat of arms consists of six elements inspired by Iceland and the president’s life: “The colours of the shield are that of the Icelandic flag. The open book refers to the study of history, university studies, and the president’s civilian career as a historian. The hammer resting atop the book is Mjölnir, representing strength, sport, and health. The waves symbolise the intertwining of Iceland’s fate and its surrounding sea while also evoking the president’s studies abroad (and the fact that he found his wife on the other side of the Atlantic). The maple leaf refers to the First Lady’s Canadian ancestry. Finally, five anchors represent the president’s children. The slogan on the coat of arms is TIBI IPSI ESTO FIDELIS, which translates to “Be true to yourself.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
842,Iceland Review,Car Taxes and Fees to Rise in Iceland,2022/09/14,"The cost of owning a car in Iceland will rise significantly next year, if the 2023 budget bill is passed in its current form. The bill proposes hikes in gasoline and emissions taxes as well as the general vehicle tax. A new tax will be imposed on electric cars and new road tolls will also be implemented. The green energy transition will require the Icelandic government to restructure how it taxes vehicles and fuel, the main source of funding for road and transport infrastructure. The hikes in fees and taxes represent a 36% increase in revenue from vehicles for the state, according to Rúnólfur Ólafsson, chairman of the Icelandic Automobile Association (FÍB). “And then this comes with new taxes on both petrol and diesel,” Rúnólfur told RÚV. “This is happening at the same time as the Minister of Infrastructure is talking about greatly increased new taxation of public use of vehicles with so-called road tolls in tunnels, over bridges, and so on.” Public transport infrastructure is limited in Iceland, meaning that the majority of the population relies on private vehicles to access employment and services. Rúnólfur says the additional costs will hurt the most vulnerable sectors of the population. “These are hugely increased charges that are being announced in one fell swoop, and we believe that this goes way too far as it is being proposed now.” The government also proposes applying a 5% minimum excise duty on all cars, meaning that a full discount will no longer be applied to electric cars. While Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson stated there will continue to be strong incentives to buy environmentally friendly cars, FÍB calculates that the excise duty and value-added tax will raise the cost of electric cars by ISK 300,000 [$2,150; €2,150], though the rise could be as much as ISK 1 million for some cars [$7,160; €7,160]. Iceland funds the maintenance and development of roads and infrastructure through taxation on vehicles and fuel. A notice on the budget bill states the restructuring of this taxation will be one of the biggest challenges for the treasury in the coming years. !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
843,Iceland Review,True Detective Series Will Be Largest-Ever Foreign Investment in Icelandic Culture,2022/09/12,"The upcoming series of HBO Max television show True Detective will be filmed in Iceland over a 9-month period for a budget of around ISK 9 billion [$64.8 million; €63.9 million]. The project entails the largest-ever foreign investment in culture in Iceland’s history. Minister of Culture Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir says the project is proof that government initiatives are helping put Iceland’s film industry on the map. While it will be filmed in Iceland, the fourth season of True Detective is in fact set in Alaska, where the story follows detectives Liz Danvers (played by Jodie Foster) and Evangeline Navarro (Kali Reis) as they investigate the disappearance of six men from a research station. True Detective has received praise from critics and audiences – and won five Emmy Awards. Iceland’s government recently raised the repayment for production costs for films and TV series shot in the country from 25% to 35%. Iceland’s Culture Minister Lilja Alfreðsdóttir presented this and other initiatives to members of the film and music industry on a recent trip to Los Angeles. “I feel a lot of support here in Los Angeles with the initiatives we have been implementing in the last year or so to promote creative industries in Iceland,” Lilja stated. “The True Detective project is the largest foreign investment in the field of culture in Iceland’s history. With a clear vision and multifaceted actions, we are succeeding in making our country a highly respected partner in the world of cinema. International film companies are ready to invest in bigger, longer-term projects than they did. It is a huge victory for Icelandic culture and economy and confirmation that what the government is doing matters.”","Culture,Politics",0,1,0,1,0,0
844,Iceland Review,2023 Budget Bill Projects Decreased Deficit,2022/09/12,"The Icelandic government’s budget bill for 2023 will run on a deficit of ISK 89 billion [$640 million; €632 million], a significant decrease from last year’s deficit of ISK 169 billion [$1.215 billion; €1.199 billion]. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson presented the budget bill at a press conference today, saying that state finances were heading “all in the right direction.” The bill will be introduced in Alþingi tomorrow. Despite running a deficit, the treasury’s debt ratio is decreasing, something Bjarni stated was very important. Treasury revenues are expected to surpass ISK 1,000 billion [$7.2 billion; €7.1 billion] in 2023. The Finance Minister stated that the treasury would be utilised to curb inflation, which is now 9.7% and rose to 9.9% last month, the highest inflation in more than a decade. In the international context, however, inflation in Iceland is the second lowest in Europe, and the impact of rising energy prices has been limited in Iceland, as the percentage of renewable energy is much higher. Prosperous fishing and tourism industries have also helped Iceland’s economy remain more stable than that of many of its neighbours. The budget includes measures to help those entering the real estate market by making more groups eligible for discounts and support measures granted to first-time buyers. It also includes increases in disability pensions and housing benefits. Taxes on vehicles and excise duties on the import of new cars will be increased in the coming year. The budget mentions that one of the biggest challenges for the government’s treasury will be a comprehensive restructuring of vehicle and fuel taxation. Iceland funds road and transport infrastructure largely through taxes imposed on gasoline, and that revenue will continue to decrease as electric and fuel-efficient cars outstrip vehicles that run on gasoline.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

Among those who paid tribute was President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson who referred to Elizabeth as “the greatest monarch of our times.” Queen Elizabeth II died yesterday at her Scottish estate in Balmoral. Her death at the age of 96 marks the end of a historic 70-year reign. As noted by the BBC, the Queen ascended to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social changes. Following news of her passing, Icelandic political leaders offered condolences to the royal family, the people of the UK, and the Commonwealth via Twitter. Among those who paid their respect were President of Iceland, Guðni Th.

During her stay, the Queen toured Thingvellir and stopped by “the Friendship Forest” in Kárastaðir, where she provided an apt commentary on the relative triviality of Icelandic forests (excerpt from Iceland Review): “The red, white and blue of Union Jacks and Icelandic flags fluttered over Reykjavik as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II toured the city on the first day of her visit, June 25, when she was introduced to some of the treasures of Icelandic art and culture … at lunch with the Prime Minister at Thingvellir, the cradle of Iceland’s democracy, the Queen referred to the visit made to Thingvellir in 1874 by her great-great-grandfather, Christian IX of Denmark, when he granted the Icelanders their first modern constitution, the first step on their road to renewed independence. Following lunch and a brief visit to Thingvellir Church, the royal party made their final stop of the country tour to plant trees at the “Friendship Forest,” which was inaugurated this spring at Karastadir. “Where is the forest?” asked Her Majesty in some surprise, as she and the president walked through the low-growing shrubs, which were planted earlier this year by the staff of the various foreign embassies in Reykjavik. Assured by President Finnbogadottir that this would become a true forest given time, the Queen went on to dig in a birch sapling of a healthy size.”

846,Iceland Review,Emaciated Horses Spur Review of MAST’s Supervisory Role,2022/09/02,"The National Audit Office will launch an assessment of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority’s (MAST) monitoring of animal welfare, RÚV reports. The decision follows, among other things, reports that the desperate condition of roughly twenty horses in Borgarnes had been reported to MAST without any immediate action being taken. On Wednesday, news broke that nearly twenty emaciated horses had been kept inside for the entire summer in a stable in Borgarnes. The condition of the horses was described as “desperate.” Speaking to RÚV on Wednesday, Steinunn Árnadóttir – who also keeps horses in the area – maintained that concerned parties had filed multiple complaints with the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST), but no action had been taken. “They’re emaciated. They’re not allowed outside. They don’t see sunlight. They’ve been deprived of green grass. There’s a filly that I saw this spring, probably in May, that’s been inside ever since.” Following these reports, the horses’ owner – who did not respond to interview requests from RÚV or other outlets – removed the horses from the stables under cover of night. RÚV reported that the person in question, who also keeps sheep and cows in other places in Borgarnes, had exhibited threatening behaviour to other residents. The Animal Welfare Association of Iceland subsequently released a public statement calling for MAST to take action: “This isn’t the first time that MAST has responded unsatisfactorily to well-reasoned claims of poor treatment of animals. MAST has the legal authority to respond to such complaints without delay … it is clear that a thorough review of the authority’s supervisory role needs to be conducted.” This morning, RÚV reported that the National Audit Office was set to launch an official review of the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority’s monitoring of animal welfare. The result of the assessment will be published in a report to Parliament. Guðmundur Björgvin Helgason, a comptroller with the National Audit Office, stated that now was an opportune time to assess MAST protocols, especially in light of the reports of emaciated horses in Borgarnes. “We regularly review possible assessments,” Guðmundur remarked, stating that administrative profiling of MAST had been undertaken in 2013, which was the year that animal welfare supervision was moved from the Ministry for the Environment to MAST. “So we’ve never had a point of contact with these sets of issues within MAST until now.” The National Audit Office’s decision to launch the assessment was, in part, spurred by a few recent instances in which MAST’s supervisory role was criticised. “Which is why we felt that it was an appropriate time to review their role. If we come across any issues with regard to MAST’s supervision, we hope to shed further light on them.” The above-mentioned Steinunn Árnadóttir, who keeps horses in Borgarnes, spoke again to Vísir today, stating that a mare and her filly were still being kept inside the aforementioned stable in Borgarnes, deprived of sunlight. According to Steinunn, the owner had been forced to put his horses, which were malnourished and in desperate conditions, to pasture, but for some reason, the mare and filly were still inside the stable.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
847,Iceland Review,Mass Resignations at the University Hospital,2022/09/02,"Fourteen emergency-room nurses completed their final shift at the National University Hospital of Iceland (Landspítali) yesterday, RÚV reports. The departures are “a cause for worry,” Director Runólfur Pálsson stated, although he remains confident that brighter days lie ahead. Speaking to RÚV yesterday, Soffía Steingrímsdóttir, who’s been employed as an emergency room nurse at the National University Hospital (Landspítali) for almost eight years, explained why she and 14 of her colleagues had decided to quit their jobs: “It’s been a long time coming. We’ve been trying to call attention to stressful work conditions and the threat to the safety of our patients for years now. Over these past two years, especially – where conditions have been unacceptable.” According to Soffía, the 14 nurses who completed their final shifts yesterday will not be easily replaced; experience and competence only come with time. A similar number of resignations are expected to be tendered next month. Speaking to RÚV, Runólfur Pálsson, Director of the National University Hospital, stated that hospital administrators would do everything in their power to reverse this trend. “The work conditions are extremely difficult. There’s a lot of stress, which means that people resign, which leads to staff shortages, which makes things even more difficult. It’s a vicious cycle that we’ve been trying to break.” Runólfur stated that he was hopeful that resources designed for patients who have completed treatment at the hospital but cannot leave on account of disabilities would help lighten the load: “And we’ve been waiting for hospital and rehabilitation rooms, which we hope will be available in September. We have high expectations for these new facilities. They will help lighten the emergency room’s load.” Soffía stated that the nurses were sad and disappointed that no measures were taken in response to their resignations: “I certainly hope that I haven’t completed my last shift at the emergency room, that I’ll return when an acceptable work environment has been created.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
848,Iceland Review,Government Publishes First-Ever Joint Policy on Land Reclamation and Reforestation,2022/08/27,"Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir has released the Icelandic government’s first-ever joint policy on land reclamation and reforestation. This per a press release on the government’s website on Friday. The plans for land reclamation and reforestation look ahead to 2031, but the primary action plan covers 2022-2026 and will shape the government’s priorities in these areas for the coming years. The action plan calls for research on the impacts of land reclamation, reforestation, and the restoration of biodiversity in the wetlands, as well as the creation of new quality criteria for reforestation land selection, and an evaluation of carbon balancing for emissions accounting. Another primary objective aims to restore the ecosystems of disturbed lands, wetlands, and both natural and newly cultivated forests. In her capacity as Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Svandís Svavarsdóttir’s focus is on the protection, proliferation, and integrity of Iceland’s ecosystems, reads the press release. She also seeks to promote nature-based solutions in climate matters, as well as solutions that are in line with international agreements, support sustainable land use, increase knowledge, cooperation, and public health, and promote sustainable development in rural Iceland. “I place a lot of emphasis on food production that’s based on sustainable development, whether that’s at land or at sea,” remarked Svandís. “With this plan, land reclamation and reforestation both contribute to sustainable development of communities all around the country. There will be employment opportunities in richer natural resources and development will be built on a sustainable foundation.” See Also: New Report Examines Food Self-Sufficiency in Five Nordic Island Societies  The policy has been prepared in accordance with recent laws on land reclamation, forests, and reforestation and outlines the government’s vision for the future in these areas, as well as its core values and attendant priorities. The policy is also guided by developments at the international level and Iceland’s international agreements with the United Nations and other global organizations. It has been in the works since 2019, when project boards were appointed with the task of formulating proposals for both a land reclamation and a national forestry plan. The two boards presented their proposals at an open forum in spring 2021, after which, the proposals were submitted to the Ministry along with an environmental assessment and a summary of the main comments received.

The dinner marked the second stop in a celebratory programme commemorating reestablished diplomatic relations between the countries. Thirty-one years have passed since the Baltic countries and Iceland reestablished diplomatic relations (August 26, 1991), after the latter became the first country to recognise the Baltic states’ independence following the fall of the Soviet Union. To commemorate the milestone, the presidents of the three Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – arrived in Iceland yesterday afternoon to participate in a celebratory programme. President of Latvia Egils Levits and First Lady Andra Levite; president of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and First Lady Diana Nausėdienė; and president of Estonia Alar Karis and First Lady Sirje Karis began their trip with a visit to Iceland’s Parliament. Birgir Ármannsson, Speaker of Parliament, welcomed the guests and offered a brief account of the institution’s history. The visitors then sat down with the representatives of Iceland’s political parties prior to concluding their evening with an official dinner at Bessastaðir, the presidential residence. Accompanying the presidents are the three countries’ ministers of foreign affairs: Edgars Rinkēvičs of Latvia, Urmas Reinsalu of Estonia, and Gabrielius Landsbergis of Lithuania.

850,Iceland Review,Icelandic Government to Research Gender Distribution of Unpaid Work,2022/08/22,"While research suggests that women do much more unpaid work in Iceland than men, concrete data on the issue is lacking. Last Friday, the Icelandic government approved Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir’s proposal to conduct a study on what is often called the “second shift” or “third shift;” unpaid housework and caretaking work; and its distribution between genders in Iceland. The results will be used to shape government policy. “In neighbouring countries, time use studies have been carried out that have been used in policy making, and an Icelandic study on this topic could give clear and easily understandable results and manage to capture the gendered reality in a different way than has previously been done,” a government notice states. The study will be carried out in collaboration with Statistics Iceland. The Icelandic government recently published its third report on mapping gender perspectives, a joint ministry initiative that maps gender perspectives in relation to government work as well as presents proposals for action. The report’s findings include that women make up the vast majority of shift workers employed by the state. These female shift workers are much more likely to work part-time than other women employed by the state. Women in Iceland are also much more likely to be granted disability status due to musculoskeletal disorders than men. The rates of musculoskeletal disorders have decreased among both women and men, however, in recent years. The government has also approved a proposal that each ministry define at least one specific gender equality goal for the 2024-2028 budget and work systematically towards it, with defined actions in the budget proposal.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

Fifty-eights projects, from 211 applications in total, received grants. Among the projects that received grants: – The development of delicacies from lamb and sheep riblets
– A marketing initiative for the export of Icelandic whiskey
– A project to maximise the productivity of home food growing systems for local vegetable production
– Potable supplements made from Icelandic algae
– A system of supervision and certification for Icelandic salt-fish products
– Protein manufacturing from Icelandic grass
– The development of flavouring products from algae for oriental food
– Foal jerky and raw sausages “The creativity and daring that Icelandic food manufacturers possess is a reason for rejoicing and goes to show that Iceland is on the right course as a food manufacturer. It’s also great to see that the gender ratio is almost even,” Svandís stated. The Food Fund awards subsidies in four categories: Bára, Kelda, Afurð, and Fjársjóður. Bára supports projects at the idea stage. Eligible grantees include companies that have been founded over the past five years, along with entrepreneurs that want to develop ideas, raw materials, or processes related to Icelandic food manufacture. Kelda supports projects that aim to acquire knowledge in support of the fund’s aims of innovation, sustainability, value creation, and the competitiveness of Iceland as a food manufacturer. Afurð supports projects that are beyond the idea phase but are not yet ready to go to market. Subsidies aim to afford grantees opportunities to develop products from raw materials created during the manufacturing process and that are conducive to the creation of value. Fjársjóður supports projects that aim to support Iceland’s marketing infrastructure and that support marketing campaigns for products connected to Icelandic food manufacture. As noted on the government’s website, the aim of the Food Fund is to support innovation in the field of food production and processing,whether agricultural or marine-product related. The fund emphasises innovation, sustainability, value-creation, and the competitiveness of Icelandic food products.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0

While the school’s playground and outdoor area are being finalised – expected to be complete in early October – Ævintýraborg will emphasise “diverse outdoor activities” in Öskjuhlíð, Nauthólsvík and near-lying areas. Once completed, Ævintýraborg will admit 100 children. Available housing owned by the city is to be utilised to meet preschool shortages this fall. Work has already begun to evaluate whether Korpuskóli school can serve as temporary facilities for preschoolers. Two additional departments are to be opened at the Bakki preschool, in the Staðarhverfi neighbourhood, in the hopes of accepting up to 160-200 additional preschoolers. Furthermore, community centres, along with other housing owned by the city and its collaborators, is to be utilised for preschoolers. This proposal is made on the condition of the parents’ interest in agreeing to these proposals and on the condition that these facilities can be staffed. Reykjavík will take advantage of an option-to-buy clause in order to purchase land in the Fossvogsdalur valley, adjacent to the city’s Cultivation Centre (Ræktunarstöð Reykjavíkur). The council will request the reclassification of the lot, and if said request is granted, an additional Ævintýraborg, capable of accommodating 100 preschoolers, will be opened next year. The Steinahlíð preschool is one of the city’s oldest preschools, currently accommodating 55 children. The council will enter into talks with Barnavinafélagið Sumargjöf, the school’s proprietor and landowner, with the aim of expanding the school, whether temporarily or for the foreseeable future. The will of the two parties to consider this expansion was addressed in an agreement regarding possible reclassification changes with regard to the Borgarlína transit system, which was approved June 18th. Subsidies to daycare providers will be increased in order to strengthen their operational conditions, lower the cost of parents, and increase the number of daycare providers. Base subsidies will also be increased and further avenues to improvements, i.e. instructional or housing subsidies, will be explored. Preschool admission protocols will be reviewed with a view to improve the dissemination of information to parents, simplify the application process, and work toward greater transparency. It is also necessary to review the possibility of integrating the application process between Reykjavík preschools and independently-operated preschools. Einar Þorsteinsson, City Council Chairman, and acting Mayor in the absence of Dagur B. Eggertsson, conducted the town-hall meeting, which was well attended by parents of waitlisted children. According to Einar, the parents’ disappointment had “not escaped the council’s notice.” “I’m happy that there was a consensus among council members regarding the proposals … everyone’s doing their best to ensure adequate accommodation.” Kristín Tómasdóttir, who has organised the protests at City Hall, took to the podium after the proposals had been introduced. Kristín stated that while she welcomed the meeting, and the fact that city council had finally introduced their proposals, she expressed the parents’ dismay that they’d been forced to expend energy  ensuring that city council do its job. “You’re here to introduce proposals that you never intended to introduce,” she said, suggesting that if it weren’t for the protests, the proposals would never have seen the light of day. “We were simply supposed to be understanding of the fact that you didn’t intend to keep your promises,” Kristín remarked.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
853,Iceland Review,Draft of Iceland’s First Comprehensive Music Policy Published,2022/08/17,"A draft of Iceland’s first comprehensive policy on music has been published on Samráðsgátt, a site for public feedback on proposed legislation. The proposed bill is the first of its kind, and it will be open for comment until August 31. The legislation is the result of a 2021 working group which identified both the central importance of music to the Icelandic economy and also the lack of a comprehensive government policy for music funding and education. The working group was composed of individuals within the Icelandic music industry, staff at the University of Iceland, and also representatives from the Ministry of Education and Children’s Affairs. Key among the recommendations of the working group were the need to establish a Music Center and to merge several existing funds, which were shown to overlap in several responsibilities. The new policy identifies music as not just one among many of Iceland’s exports, but instead as a cornerstone of Icelandic education, tourism, and commerce. Given its central importance, the new legislation hopes to shape music policy in Iceland through 2030 in a way that has already been done in other cultural fields. In addition to the new, streamlined structure for funding, the new bill hopes to increase total funding for music in Iceland. The new bill will consist of two separate action plans, one valid through 2026, and the other until 2030. As of now, only the action plan for the years 2023 – 2026 has been published. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Culture and Tourism, said in a statement: “This is a major turning point, and with the policy and the law on music, we are working to promote music throughout the country and, for the first time, define a comprehensive framework for the issue of music that has been lacking for a long time. With this, we want to create the conditions for music to grow and prosper for a long time to come.”","Culture,Politics",0,1,0,1,0,0
854,Iceland Review,Twelve People Deported Under Police Escort Since May,2022/08/13,"Twelve people have been deported from Iceland under police escort since the end of May, Fréttablaðið reports. Per information obtained from the National Commissioner of Police, the individuals were escorted to Georgia, Albania, the UK, Greece, Spain, Italy, France, The Netherlands, and Canada. Only adults were deported, not children, and all were escorted out of the country on an individual basis. Of the 12 people in question, five were taken back to their country of origin on the basis of “illegal stay” in Iceland. Four were detainees. Three were people whose applications for asylum were rejected; these individuals were delivered to countries where they had already received international protection. In May, it was announced that 300 people said to be in Iceland “illegally” would be deported. This number was eventually decreased to 197 people when it was decided that families with children would not be deported. Gunnar Hörður Garðarsson said that each of the Directorate of Immigration’s requests for police escorts for deportees are “carefully processed” and that asylum seekers are also “given the option of leaving the country without a police escort.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
855,Iceland Review,Apologize or Face Cyberattack: Icelandic Paper Faces Threats from Hackers and Ire of Russian Embassy,2022/08/12,"The Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið received a threat from Russian hackers on Thursday morning: apologize before midnight, Moscow-time (9:00 PM in Iceland) or face a cyberattack in retaliation. The hackers want the paper’s editors to issue a formal apology for publishing a photograph of someone using a Russian flag as a doormat with the caption: “Ukrainians have found a new use for the Russian flag.” Fréttablaðið and Stundin are reporting on this story. ‘A manifest of uncovered disrespect towards the Russian Federation’ The image in question appeared as part of an interview with Valur Gunnarsson, an Icelandic journalist who is currently in Ukraine. Upon its publication on Wednesday, the photograph almost immediately caught the attention of the Embassy in Iceland, which sent Fréttablaðið’s Editor-in-Chief Sigmundur Ernir Rúnarsson a letter demanding an apology for “breaching the existing law and common moral values, as well as journalist ethics.” “We would like to remind you that the Icelandic government hasn’t repealed yet Art. 95 of the General Penal Code of Iceland, according to which anyone who publicly insults foreign state symbols shall be fined or even imprisoned,” the letter states, calling the image “a manifest of uncovered disrespect towards the Russian Federation and its state symbols.” The Russian Embassy urged the editors to respond immediately, and “not waste time defending this under the cover of free speech.” Two Icelandic authors were convicted under same law for insulting Hitler The legal provision cited by the Russian Embassy—which can technically carry with it a prison sentence of up to six years—is rarely enacted, although it does have a fairly colourful history. The most famous instances of Icelanders being sentenced under this legal provision occurred in 1934, during the leadup to World War II. First, author Þórbergur Þórðarson stood trial and was fined for calling Adolf Hitler a “sadist” in an article he wrote for the socialist paper Alþýðublaðið called “The Nazis’ Sadistic Appetite.” Later that same year, poet Steinn Steinarr was sentenced under the same article when he and four other people cut down a swastika flag at the German consulate in Siglufjörður. More recently, rapper and artist Erpur Eyvindarson and two friends were sentenced under the same provision after throwing a Molotov cocktail at the U.S. Embassy in 2002. It was determined that the trio had not intended to harm anyone with the homemade combustable, but rather deface the exterior of the embassy. As such, they were found guilty of insulting a foreign state and its citizens instead of a more serious crime. In 2017, Left-Green MPs submitted a resolution to appeal the provision, saying, among other things, that it posed an infringement on free expression. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposed the repeal, however, arguing that the provision was justified under the terms of international agreements and treaties of friendship. ‘After hacking your paper’s website, we will publish photos of kompromat’ On Thursday morning, the Fréttablaðið website was subjected to what seemed to be a preliminary or warning attack. “We noticed this morning that the traffic on the website suddenly snowballed and it was clear that it was part of an attack on the website,” said Sigmundur Ernir. The ISP already had security measures in place to protect the website and additional steps were then taken to try and prevent further incursions on its functionality. At time of writing, the Fréttablaðið website was still active and accessible, although keeping it functional was difficult, according to sources at the paper. Shortly after the initial attack, the Fréttablaðið editors received a more explicit email from the hackers responsible, saying: “What right do you have to insult or dishonour the symbols of another nation!!! If you do not apologize on Thursday, August 11 before 24:00 Moscow-time! [sic] We will hack your website and provider. Then after hacking your paper’s website, we will publish photos of kompromat on your publication and you will for sure face a criminal sentence for corruption, banditry [English word used in original message], etc.” Ivan Glinkin, Communications Director for the Russian Embassy, says the embassy has no idea who is responsible for the attacks on the Fréttablaðið website. Asked if the embassy believes such attacks are in any way an appropriate response to the publication of the offending photo, Glinkin said the embassy condemns all illegal actions, no matter what they are. ‘The flag is almost beside the point’ Editor-in-chief Sigmundur Ernir stated that his paper would not be issuing an apology for publishing a journalistic image taken in a conflict zone but is taking the threat seriously and has referred the matter to the police. Fréttablaðið has also contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has expressed support for the paper’s position. The Union of Icelandic Journalists (BÍ) also published a statement of support on Thursday, saying “the importance of an independent and free media is particularly vital in times of war and BÍ condemns all attempts to influence the media’s coverage of the war in Ukraine.” “There’s nothing sacred in a war where children, mothers, and the elderly are killed and whole communities destroyed,” Sigmundur Ernir remarked in an interview with Vísir the same day. “So the flag is almost beside the point, as flags are trampled in many places around the world in protest. I think Russians should think first and foremost about treating the nations around them with decency rather than whining about a photo in Fréttablaðið.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
856,Iceland Review,Municipal Authorities Suggest Egilsstaðir for Development as Alternate Airport,2022/08/11,"Municipal authorities in the eastern district of Fljótsdalshérað want to strengthen the infrastructure of the Egilsstaðir airport due to the ongoing seismic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula, RÚV reports. It’s possible that the current eruption in Meradalir and last year’s eruption in Geldingadalur herald the arrival of a long period of volcanic unrest on the Reykjanes peninsula, something that would put the Keflavík airport—and the single roadway leading to it—at significant risk. As such, many political leaders, including Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Minister of Infrastructure Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, agree about the importance of establishing an alternate airport somewhere else in the country. Egilsstaðir is not the only town angling for airport development, however. Just last week, Halla Signý Kristjánsdóttir, an MP for the Progressive Party and a member of the transportation committee, suggested that an airport could be built in Mýrar in Borgarfjörður, West Iceland. Akureyri in North Iceland has also been put forth as an option. Vilhjálmur Jónsson, one of the local government chairmen in Fljótsdalshérað, says Egillstaðir is well-suited for the project. “The conditions at Egilsstaðir are in some ways more suitable and I also think that if there are going to be these weekly disruptions that [it would be good to be able to] spread flights to other airports if there was a major incident.” “The situation is not a new one,” Vilhjálmur concluded, “but these earthquakes on Reykjanes now will maybe finally push it.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
857,Iceland Review,New United States Ambassador to Iceland Appointed,2022/08/08,"The United States Senate has confirmed Carrin F. Patman as the next US Ambassador to Iceland. Patman is a lawyer by training and was a major fundraiser in both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden’s electoral campaigns in 2016 and 2020, respectively. Vísir reported first. Patman, 65, was nominated for the position by Joe Biden in February. At the time of her nomination, she stated she had picked up some basic Icelandic, though in her words: “Just a little.” Patman has been chair of Houston Metro in Houston, Texas since 2010. She was previously a partner at Bracewell LLP, where her specialisations included class action litigation and environmental violations. She was a founding board member of the Center for Women in Law and has been a leader in women’s rights organisations in Texas. In a statement, Patman said she hoped to “strengthen our cooperation and understanding between the governments of the United States and Iceland.” The last US ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, was a controversial figure, not least for the social media posts he made throughout his tenure. A US government report published late last year revealed that embassy staff were still recovering from the “threatening and intimidating environment” created by Gunter.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
858,Iceland Review,Minister’s Assistant Silent on Purpose of Meeting with Namibian Officials,2022/08/02,"Brynjar Níelsson, assistant to the Minister of Justice, has refused to disclose the purpose of a meeting he had with Namibian officials at Iceland’s Ministry of Justice last June 7. He has stated that the meeting was not an official meeting and is therefore not subject to the Information Act. Namibian authorities would not confirm to Fréttablaðið that the meeting concerned private affairs. Namibia’s Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney General, and Deputy Director General of the Namibian Anti-Corruption Commission visited Iceland last June. The purpose of their trip was to meet with investigators of the so-called Fishrot Files scandal, involving the operations of one of Iceland’s largest seafood companies in Namibia. The company, Samherji, allegedly bribed Namibian government officials to gain access to lucrative fishing grounds, while also taking advantage of international loopholes to avoid taxes. While in the country last June, Namibian officials met with Brynjar at the Ministry of Justice. Brynjar sat in as Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson’s representative, as the Minister was absent at the time. The Namibian officials had met with Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir earlier that same day. Opposition MP Helga Vala Helgadóttir, of the Social-Democratic Alliance, has criticised Brynjar for staying silent on the substance of the meeting. “The Assistant to the Minister of Justice does not meet with the Deputy Prime Minister of Namibia, the Attorney General of Namibia, and the Deputy Director General of the Namibian Anti-Corruption Commission on behalf of the Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson to discuss private matters.

859,Iceland Review,Regional Division of Coastal Fishing Quotas May Be Reinstated,2022/07/28,"Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Svandís Svavarsdóttir would like to make the coastal fishing system fairer, not least by reinstating a regional division of fishing quotas, RÚV reports. According to the National Association of Small Boat Owners, 700 boats caught 11,000 tons of cod during Iceland’s costal fishing season this year, as well as 1,500 tons of coalfish (also called pollock), and 105 tons of other catch. On average, 656 kilos [1446 lbs] of cod were caught per fishing trip, which is a 6% increase over last year. Fish prices have never been higher than they are this summer. The average price for cod is 23% higher than it was last year; coalfish is currently priced an astounding 85% higher than it was in 2021. Nevertheless, the costal fishing season was short—only 46 days—and ended last Friday, about a month earlier than planned. This decision has been widely criticized with some saying that the sea is full of fish that may not be caught. Not everyone getting their fair share Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir says that the season ended “sooner than we would have liked,” and said the decision to end the season last week had to do with how much fish had been caught overall. But she recognizes that under the terms of the current system, coastal fishermen are not all on equal footing with one another. As such, it is her intention to reinstate the regional division of fishing quotas. “That will make it more likely that everyone gets their cut,” she explained, “as opposed to when the entire country is defined as one region.” Under the current arrangement, some fishermen are able to catch their fair share, she continued, “especially in the north and east.” Current system not a failure, but ‘far too complicated’ Under the current quota system, coastal fishing quotas make up 5% of the total catch. In the long term, Svandís says she’d like to see the coastal fishing quota make up a larger part of the overall quota. She was not, however, prepared to quote a particular figure at this time. Asked if she considered the current fishing system a failure, Svandís said no, but she did concede that it’s a very complicated one. “It’s far too complicated; it can be simplified and clarified and I think that when we’re thinking about simplifying it and clarifying it, we also need to [give some thought to] making it more equitable.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
860,Iceland Review,Extra Meetings to Prepare for Upcoming Wage Negotiations,2022/07/26,"The National Economic Council has held extra meetings in order to prepare for this autumn’s collective agreement negotiations, RÚV reports. Nearly 160 collective agreements expire this fall, and continued inflation, now at 9.9%, is expected to complicate talks. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir expressed concern about the economic situation. “The economic situation here in Iceland is complicated, as elsewhere in Europe,” Katrín stated. “I am concerned about the economic situation, not least because we are emerging from the recession caused by the global pandemic and have entered another situation closely connected to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Housing costs are a key factor in rising inflation, and the Prime Minister says it is important to address inflation by ensuring additional housing availability. The state and municipal authorities signed an agreement earlier this month to build an additional 35,000 apartments over the next ten years. Katrín stated that addressing housing availability was only one of several measures that were required. While inflation has impacted purchasing power in Iceland in recent months, wage increases over the past year have mitigated its effect. Purchasing power decreased by 0.9% between June 2021 and June 2022 in Iceland according to data from Landsbankinn bank. It has not been lower since December 2020. Purchasing power is expected to continue decreasing over the coming months, as inflation is expected to continue rising and no collective agreements account for wage increases before October. Over 100,000 workers’ collective agreements expire in October or November. The National Economic Council (Þjóðhagsráð), which includes government ministers as well as representatives from unions, municipal governments, the Central Bank, and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise (SA), has been holding additional meetings to prepare for the upcoming negotiations. “I think it is very important to continue this conversation,” the Prime Minister stated.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
861,Iceland Review,ISK 80 Million Towards Reconstruction Efforts in Afghanistan,2022/07/26,"The Icelandic government will contribute ISK 80 million [$583,000; €575,000] to the United Nations Multi Partner Special Trust Fund for Afghanistan. The funds are to be used for development projects in the country as well as humanitarian aid. The United Nations estimates that more than half of the country’s population currently requires humanitarian aid. “Afghanistan is in complete crisis and the need for both humanitarian and development aid is extremely urgent,” Iceland’s Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir stated. “It is therefore extremely important that Iceland does its part to respond to the disasters that have occurred there, both caused by nature and humans.” Last month’s deadly earthquake worsened already difficult conditions in Afghanistan. Social infrastructure has collapsed and access to basic services is extremely poor. The Multi Partner Special Trust Fund prioritises projects that focus on ensuring basic services, providing for people’s basic needs, promoting economic recovery, protecting agriculture against natural disasters, and increasing resilience and social cohesion.

862,Iceland Review,‘Of course they are lying’: Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Under Fire for Comments about LGBTQIA+ Asylum Seekers,2022/07/24,"Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Helgi Magnús Gunnarsson has come under fire for comments he made on his Facebook page concerning asylum seekers who apply for international protection in Iceland on the basis of their sexuality. Vísir reports that the comments were made in the wake of an interview with lawyer Helgi Þorsteinsson Silva, who said he believed the incident reflected consistent governmental bias, namely that the government routinely assumed that asylum seekers were lying about their sexuality in their applications. ‘Is there any shortage of gays in Iceland?’ In the interview, lawyer Helgi Þorsteinsson Silva revealed that the government accused his client of lying about his sexuality and had refused him asylum on that basis. Helgi asserted that the accusation was indicative of a pattern of unfounded accusations and asylum application rejections and indeed, the district court later reversed the government’s decision in his client’s favour. The interview, which was published by Vísir on Thursday, was shared on Facebook by Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Helgi Magnús. “Of course they are lying,” wrote Helgi Magnús in a now-removed post on his Facebook page. “Most people come here in search of more money and a better life. Who wouldn’t lie to save themselves? Apart from that, is there any shortage of gays in Iceland?” It bears noting that this is not the first time Helgi Magnús has come under fire for inflammatory public statements. In 2019, he was investigated in Stundin after expressing anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment, both online and in a speech given at an international conference on human rights and migration in Berlin. In 2021, he was criticized for liking Facebook posts that call into question the testimony of women who say they’ve been the victim of domestic abuse. Confirmation of systemic prejudice Álfur Birkir Bjarnarson, chairman of Samtökin ’78, was quick to respond, emphasizing that Helgi Magnús’ comments were indicative of systemic prejudice against LGBTQIA+ people in Iceland’s judicial system. “I don’t know that there’s a shortage or excess of redheads, gays, men, or women,” he wrote. “These are just people, and we take them into society as they come.” Álfur Birkir continued by saying that the Deputy Director’s comments say more about him than asylum seekers, as well as underlining some painful realities about the justice system in general. “This is just confirmation of what we’ve experienced first-hand—that there is most assuredly prejudice within the system and [that] systemic prejudice against LGBTQIA+ people, immigrants, and other minority groups is quite evident within the system. This is yet one more confirmation for those of us who have experienced this and are moved to examine it.” ‘Really likes gay people’ In a follow-up interview after his initial post, Helgi Magnús repeated his position, saying that it was neither abnormal for people to lie about their sexuality in asylum applications, nor for the government to investigate their claims. He said he was not commenting on a specific case, but more generally. He also questioned whether a person’s sexuality should be a factor in their receiving asylum over someone else. Asked to speak to his comments about there being “no shortage of gays in Iceland,” Helgi said he really liked gay people and had never had anything against them. (At time of writing, Helgi Magnús had added a ‘Pride 2022’ frame on his Facebook profile photo.) He said he didn’t want to comment further on the matter because there was no reason to. The fact that his comments had aroused significant comment and coverage in the media was simply a result of a series of slow news days in Iceland, he said, and could hardly be considered real news. Álfur Birkir was circumspect about Helgi Magnús’ response, saying that it was all well and good to hear that the Deputy Director had nothing against gay people but that it was time to see that in action. “It’s good to hear,” he remarked, “I only wish him well with that, but it would be good to see that in action, then. As an arm of the system, he has a great responsibility—not only to show ‘ahostility,’ but also literal affection as part of the system.” Proving sexuality ‘something that heterosexual people would never have to do’ Left-Green PM Jódís Skúladóttir has since spoken out on the matter, not only against Helgi Magnús’ comments, but also against the injustice of making asylum seekers prove their sexuality.  “These are extremely depressing comments that in reality, completely condemn themselves,” said Jódís. “It is, of course, a serious matter that people in positions of power, all the way from the bottom to the top in our system, give themselves permission to speak this way. I take this very seriously.” “How unfortunately worded, that there’s no need for more gay people here,” she continued. “I don’t think we need any more white, heterosexual, middle-age men in management positions.” In the interview that incited all this commentary, lawyer Helgi Þorsteinsson Silva also noted that LGBTQIA+ asylum seekers often have to go to great lengths to prove their sexuality, which is frequently called into question even if they are in a relationship or married. Jódís spoke to this as well, saying, “It’s obviously crazy that people have to—at any time, for any reason—prove their sexuality, which is, of course, something that heterosexual people would never have to do.” “I want to point out that here, in our society, which is considered progressive and tolerant in many respects, there are a lot of people who are reluctant to be open about their sexuality,” Jódís continued. “People are ostracized, rejected, subjected to violence—and that’s in this good, open society. Just imagine being a refugee, from a country where a death sentence might even await you. [Imagine] being in mortal danger if you are open about your sexuality. It’s obvious that you’re not going to advertise it on social media, that you haven’t publicly admitted it.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

Björn states that he hopes to simplify the organizational structure of the hospital system. Specifically, he highlights as a problem the excess of employees in the hospital system not directly involved with patient care.

The decision came in partial response to a working group formed last year, which highlighted the need for both social housing and affordable housing in Iceland. The working group emphasized the nearly-unprecedented explosion in housing costs over the last two years and the need to increase housing supply in order to insulate Icelanders, especially those with low income, from the effects of the real estate market. The agreement is to run from 2023 to 2032, with a goal of 4,000 units a year for the first five years. Of these new units, 30% of them are to be affordable housing, and 5% are to be set aside as social housing, housing which municipalities have a legal obligation to provide to some qualifying individuals and families. Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, Minister of Infrastructure, stated that a major goal of the new agreement is to protect residents from the large fluctuations that have characterized the last years. These fluctuations have especially impacted first-time homebuyers, who are having difficulty entering the market because of the ballooning prices. The agreement also aims to streamline some aspects of housing development, including an increased emphasis on digital housing plans and bringing several other regulatory processes under one common framework.    ","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
866,Iceland Review,Two Hundred and Sixty Officials Overpaid for Three Years,2022/07/02,"Two hundred and sixty nationally elected officials, government ministers, and civil servants have been overpaid for the last three years, RÚV reports. The overpayment was a result of an error in calculating annual wage increases and amounts to a total of ISK 105 million [$785,928; €753,783], or roughly ISK 400,000 [$2,994; €2,871] per person. The recipients will be required to repay their excess salary. Every year, the Financial Management Authority (FJS) updates the salaries of nationally elected individuals, government ministers, and civil servants in accordance with figures provided by Statistics Iceland and the Wage and Human Resources Administration. These increases are outlined in a law that was passed in 2019. However, in preparation for the wage increases for 2022, it was discovered that the wrong index has been used to determine the salaries of this group for three years, or ever since the law went into effect. Instead of basing the wage increase for this group on the average increase in the regular wages of government employees from year to year, as is specified in the law, the benchmark for increases has been the wage index for government employees. A total of 260 people—including President Guðni Th.

867,Iceland Review,Fourth Round of Changes Proposed to Election Legislation,2022/06/30,"A plan to review Iceland’s election legislation has been published on the government’s consultation website Samráðsgátt. New election legislation that took effect in January of this year caused headaches for smaller municipalities in municipal elections last May. RÚV reported first. The new legislation tightened requirements for election committee members by ruling out anyone with close connections to candidates in the municipality. Those whose spouse, partner, sibling, child, grandchild, or even certain in-laws were running in the election were disqualified from being on the election committee, which made it a great challenge for municipalities with small populations to staff their election committees. The article on election committee qualifications is not the only one the legislators intend to change. The plan also considers it necessary to amend the article concerning outer ballot envelopes, which reportedly caused counting delays in the May election. While the election legislation was written through a process of broad consultation between 2016 and 2020, it has already been amended three times to address deficiencies, including discrepancies in calendar dates.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
868,Iceland Review,Permanent Military Presence in Iceland Not on Government’s Agenda,2022/06/30,"Iceland’s National Security Council has no plans to request permanent military presence in Iceland, according to the country’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Katrín told RÚV that Iceland is, however, reviewing its national security policy and working on an updated risk assessment in light of the war in Ukraine. The security environment in Europe is in a period of change following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has led to Finland and Sweden applying for NATO membership, a move Iceland’s government has supported. NATO member countries regularly monitor the airspace over Iceland, and increasing that monitoring is a consideration. The Prime Minister says, however, there are no plans to reinstate permanent military presence in Iceland. Both Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Foreign Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir are currently attending a NATO summit in Madrid. “We have not been discussing a permanent military presence in Iceland, that we have not been discussing,” Katrín told RÚV reporters, adding that the current priorities of Iceland’s security policy were twofold: reviewing security policy and updating the risk assessment for Iceland. The current security policy was implmented in 2016, and although the Prime Minister believes it has served well, there are “certain points that need to be fine-tuned.” The risk assessment focuses mostly on how Iceland can increase its preparedness, and Katrín emphasised that this does not involve any sort of permanent military presence. Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir stated the government intends to increase investment at Keflavík Airport, taking into account NATO’s security priorities. Those priorities, however, are mainly focused on the east and south of NATO’s area of influence, Þórdís stated. As for a permanent military presence in Iceland, Þórdís stated: “It’s not on the agenda.” Iceland is a founding member of NATO but does not have its own military. US forces maintained a permanent presence in the country from World War II until 2006.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
869,Iceland Review,Icelandic Breweries Can Now Sell Directly to Customers,2022/06/30,"Starting tomorrow, July 1, breweries in Iceland will be permitted to sell their alcoholic products directly to customers. The change is thanks to a parliamentary bill passed on June 15 that somewhat relaxes the state monopoly on alcohol sales. While some say it’s high time alcohol was available for sale outside of state-run stores, others are wary increased availability will lead to higher rates of alcoholism. The changes are long overdue, according to Ólafur Stephensen, CEO of the Icelandic Federation of Trade. He told RÚV that he hopes to see legislation concerning alcohol sales relaxed even further. See Also: Business Booming for Online Alcohol Retailers “The goal of the bill was, among other things, to strengthen culture-related tourism around breweries in the countryside. The result is that one or two breweries are excluded, both in Eyjafjörður [North Iceland]. And one producer of spirits in Borgarnes. There is no logic to that,” Ólafur stated, adding that there is no reason producers of spirits shouldn’t also be allowed to sell their products on site. “These are companies that have the same criteria and have been building up tourism around their operations and production. These breweries produce too much and are therefore too big to fall under these legal amendments.” The lack of alcoholic beverages in Icelandic grocery stores catches many foreign tourists by surprise. The state-run liquor store, Vínbúðin, is expensive, and opening hours can be sporadic during holidays and in more rural parts of the country. Vínbúðin stores are always closed on Sundays. While some have argued that increased access to alcohol will lead to increased alcohol abuse, a recent survey shows that almost half of Icelanders want beer and wine to be available in supermarkets.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
870,Iceland Review,Ministry Suspends Residential Development by City Airport,2022/06/28,"The Ministry of Infrastructure considers the new residential development by Reykjavík City Airport to threaten the operational safety of the airport and has ordered construction at the site to be postponed, RÚV reports. A letter from the Minister of Infrastructure sent to the Mayor of Reykjavík last week states that the planned development would significantly reduce the operational safety of the airport. The City of Reykjavík’s land-use plan assumes that the airport will be relocated – but the government’s transport policy states that it must continue to operate until another airport is built. The letter states that it is “totally unacceptable for such projects to be undertaken without fully examining whether – and in what way, it is ensured that they do not have a negative effect on the operational safety of Reykjavík Airport. The Ministry cannot agree to the commencement of construction unless it is demonstrated that aviation and operational safety are not endangered.” The Ministry has appointed a working group of experts to research the issue. They are expected to submit their findings on October 1. Einar Þorsteinsson, Acting Mayor of Reykjavík while Dagur B. Eggertsson is on leave, says the city cannot afford to lose the 690 new apartments that are in the first phase of construction of the new neighbourhood. He points out that the neighbourhood’s design is based on two previous reports concerning airport safety in the context of the construction. “I hope it will be possible to build a beautiful neighbourhood there, which serves those groups who are in dire need of housing and at the same time ensure the operational safety of the airport,” Einar stated. Read More: Relocating Reykjavík Airport  There have been tentative plans to relocate Reykjavík City Airport for decades. The City of Reykjavík’s 2010-2030 land-use plan assumes that the airport will be relocated – but the government’s 2019-2033 Transport Policy states that Reykjavík City Airport in Vatnsmýri must continue to serve domestic flights in a satisfactory manner until another equally good or better option exists. City authorities have maintained that the first phase of construction in Skerjafjörður would not affect the airport’s operation.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
871,Iceland Review,Increased Legal Rights for Victims of Sexual Assault in Iceland,2022/06/28,"Victims of sexual assault in Iceland can now receive information on the proceedings of the police investigation of their case and are permitted to be present at the trial, thanks to legislative amendments passed by Parliament, RÚV reports. A spokesperson from Stígamót, a centre for survivors of sexual violence, says the changes are a step forward but more needs to be done. “I think this is a turning point and shows that there is will within the system towards victims of violence and there is a strong need for that. As we know, many cases are dismissed and victims are often unhappy with how they are received in the legal system and feel their need for justice is not fulfilled,” Steinunn Gyðu- og Guðjónsdóttir, a spokesperson for Stígamót, stated. Icelandic legislation concerning sexual assault cases is structured in such a way that the victims in such cases are categorised as witnesses rather than parties to the case. This means they have little to no access to information concerning the proceedings of their case and may not be present at court proceedings. Experts and activists have been vocal in their criticism of this system, which was evaluated as lagging being most other Nordic countries when it comes to protecting victims’ rights. The amendments change victims’ status in their case in several ways. Firstly, they may be present in closed court proceedings concerning their cases or watch them through a stream in the courthouse. Victims also receive increased access to the data of their case during the investigation and their legal rights protector (a lawyer assigned to protect their interests) is permitted to question those who are brought before the court. Authorities also have additional responsibilities thanks to the amendments, including to inform the victim if a ruling has been made concerning the accused or if the accused has been released from custody. The bill has undergone considerable changes since it was first introduced last year. Steinunn is pleased the voices of Stígamót and the women’s movement have been heeded, but is disappointed that victims are still defined as witnesses in their own cases. This continues to limit their legal rights: they cannot, for example, sue the state if a mistake has been made in their case. “As we have been seeing in the Court of Appeal, sentences are often being lightened because of how long the investigation has taken but victims do not receive such compensation.” The procedural time for sexual assault cases can be up to a year and half with the police and just as long once they are in the hands of the prosecution. “The system really needs an injection of manpower and funding to fix that,” Steinunn stated. “This is just the legal status. Now the implementation needs to be fixed.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0

873,Iceland Review,Icelandic State Pays Damages to Pregnant Woman Who Was Deported,2022/06/23,"The Icelandic state has paid damages to an Albanian asylum seeker who was deported from the country in her ninth month of pregnancy. The woman was deported in November 2019, then 26 years old, along with her husband and two-year-old son despite having a medical certificate stating that “a long flight would be difficult for her.” The woman’s lawyer told Vísir her client is relieved at the outcome and hopes it will prevent the Icelandic state from putting other women’s health and safety at risk, as well as that of their unborn children. Despite having a certificate from the National University Hospital stating she had back problems and that a long flight would be difficult for her, the woman was deported on the basis of a second medical certificate procured by police. The woman asserts that she was never examined by the doctor who signed this second certificate. The deportation was protested at the time it occurred, with the Directorate of Health launching an investigation into the deportation procedure to determine whether it violated health regulations. The Directorate of Health eventually ruled that the doctor who signed the second certificate broke laws applying to healthcare workers and patient rights. Claudia Ashanie Wilson, the woman’s lawyer, confirmed that the Icelandic state had recognised its liability in the case. She spoke with her client two days ago, and says the woman was relieved that the Icelandic state had acknowledged that it had violated her rights in deporting her when she was nearly 36 weeks pregnant. She declined to state the amount that was paid to the woman. “This incident will hopefully make the Icelandic authorities reflect and ensure the humane treatment of those individuals who apply for international protection here in Iceland. We seem to forget sometimes that these are people, individuals like us, who are in great need,” Claudia stated.","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
874,Iceland Review,"Parliament Outlaws Teen Marriage, Eases Divorce for Abuse Sufferers",2022/06/20,"The Minister of Justice’s bill to amend marital law was recently passed in Parliament, removing the Ministry’s warrant to grant exceptions that would allow individuals under eighteen to marry. Another amendment to marital law was also passed recently, making it easier for sufferers of domestic abuse to get a divorce from their abusive partners. In Iceland, people under the age of eighteen are not allowed to wed, but until now, the Ministry of Justice has been able to grant exemptions from that rule. From 1998 to 2018, eighteen children under eighteen were granted such an exemption, most of them seventeen years old. The new legislation also passes into law a basic rule that Icelandic authorities will recognise marriages that have taken place in other countries if they fulfil the requirements made in the country of origin. Matrimony is not recognised in Iceland if one or both individuals were under 18 when the nuptials took place. The main goal is to coordinate Icelandic marriage legislation with international recommendations and norms concerning the minimum age for matrimony. Parliament also amended the legislation regarding Icelandic authorities’ jurisdiction to grant a divorce in cases where neither party lives in the country or is an Icelandic citizen. An individual can now file suit for divorce if the ceremony occurred in Iceland, and they can prove that the complainant can’t file suit in their country or country of residence. Parliament also passed a bill that makes it easier for people who have suffered domestic abuse to get an immediate divorce from their partner. Usually, married couples are first legally separated for at least six months before being able to get a divorce, but in some cases, couples can request an immediate divorce. If both parties agree, they can get an immediate divorce, also in cases of adultery, if the couple has lived apart due to disagreement for two years or more, or if one of them was already married at the time of the nuptials. Until now, victims of domestic violence have been forced to endure a minimum of six months of legal separation unless their partner acknowledges that they have been abusive. Sufferers of domestic abuse can now request an immediate divorce if their spouse acknowledges the violence or has been sentenced, the police confirm a domestic violence report, or if they can produce injury notes or a therapist’s report indicating domestic abuse. Domestic abuse sufferers will also have a right to expedited divorce proceedings.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
875,Iceland Review,Parliament Grants 12 Individuals Icelandic Citizenship,2022/06/16,"Parliamentary parties have agreed to process 25 out of the 70 requests for Icelandic citizenship Parliament has received, Vísir reports. This was one of the last points of argument before Parliament can be closed for summer. Minority parties the Social Democratic Alliance, the Pirate Party and the Reform Party were not satisfied with the way the government parties wanted to approach citizenship applications this year and were ready to postpone the closing of parliament until they had reached a decision. The parties reached an agreement this week and agreed to process 25 of the 70 applications Parliament had received. The other 45 will be processed as soon as Parliament opens again in the autumn. The reason for the delay is a change in the Directorate of Immigrations’ procedures regarding the applications ordered by Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson. Parliament needs to consult the Directorate of Immigrations’ application reviews when processing the applications but the Minister requested that the Directorate would not prioritise the applications for Parliament over others. When the delays of the Parliament applications became clear last spring the Directorate was criticised for an attempt to change the citizenship procedures but they revealed the process was changed on the request of the Minister of Justice. Following the debate, the Directorate was charged with turning in the application reviews to the Parliament but now, as Parliament is closing fur summer, only 25 out of 70have been turned in. As part of the agreement to delay processing 45 applications until autumn, the parties will form a committee this summer to figure out how best to handle this in the future. Usually, Parliament grants citizenships twice a year, just before Christmas break and the summer holidays. Out of the 25 applications processed yesterday, 12 people were granted Icelandic citizenship. Among the lucky dozen is musician John Grant and refugee Uhunoma Osayomore. John has worked in Iceland for a long time while Uhunoma’s case made headlines last year when he was denied asylum by Icelandic authorities. Last year, another well-known musician who has worked in Iceland for a long time was granted citizenship through the same process when Damon Albarn became an Icelandic citizen.  ",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0
876,Iceland Review,Master Plan Passed Through Parliament Despite Opposition,2022/06/16,"The third phase of the Master Plan for Nature Protection and Energy Utilisation was passed through Parliament yesterday, with 34 votes for and seven against. Fifteen abstained from voting. The Master Plan was last passed through Parliament just under ten years ago and has often proven divisive as it mandates which rivers will be developed for hydropower plants and which ones will be allowed to remain untouched. Before the Master Plan passed through Parliament, the Environment and Communications Committee made some compromises that have been hotly contested by nature conservationists and the minority parties in Parliament. An outline of which rivers will be developed for Hydro power plants The Master Plan contains a list of locations where hydropower plants could theoretically rise and divides them into three categories: the Energy Utilisation category for places suitable for power plant construction, the On-hold category for places that require more research and preparation to figure out if they’re suitable or not, and the Protected category, for places that are deemed necessary for nature conservation. Controversial options put on hold The Environment and Communications Committee’s majority published the results of their work recently and in what looks like an effort to compromise and hold off on making decisions about controversial locations, Kjalölduveita and Héraðsvötn will be moved from the Protection category to On Hold while Skrokkalda and powerplants in the lower part of Þjórsá river will be moved from the Energy Utilisation category to the on-hold category. Minority and conservationists object, division within majority parties Representatives of the Icelandic Environment Association have stated that there is no new data to support moving these two places to the on-hold category and that the change is entirely political. Three minority parties in Parliament had suggested an amendment to the bill that would keep Héraðsvötn and Kjalölduveita in the protected category instead of moving them to the On-hold category. The suggestion was rejected with 33 votes against 21. One MP abstained and Bjarni Jónsson, MP for the Left-green movement voted for it, the only MP in the Majority to do so. Bjarni is one of the Left-green Movements representatives in the Environment and Communications Committee and refused to sign the committee’s report, due to his opposition to moving Héraðsvötn to the On-hold category. Orri Páll Jóhannsson, the other of two Left-Green representatives in the committee told RÚV: “If we need to enlarge the on-hold category to pass it through parliament I will stick by the decision with the arguments mentioned in the committee report, reiterating that power options in the on-hold category will be reassessed.” On the subject of Héraðsvötn and Kjalölduveita, Orri recognised that the rivers have significant nature conservation interest but that they are controversial and need to be investigated further. He maintained that moving these places to the on-hold category did not mean that they would be moved to the energy utilisation category straight away, absolutely not.","Nature,Politics",0,0,1,1,0,0
877,Iceland Review,New Response Team To Tackle Emergency Ward’s Issues,2022/06/14,"The Ministry of Health has founded a new response team for Emergency healthcare services on the advice of the Director of Health. The National Hospital’s Council of Specialists has issued a statement where they declared grave worries over staffing. According to the Health Ministry’s notice, the Ministry, the Directorate of Health, Icelandic Health Insurance, the regional healthcare institutions, and the Capital Area’s Off-hour Medical Clinic have formed a response team on Emergency Healthcare services in Iceland. The reason is the grave situation within the emergency services but the notice also states that the reasons for this situation is complicated, but dominating factors are lack of trained healthcare professionals and lack of resources for senior citizens, disabled people and other sensitive demographics. Among the action plans are coordination of actions and tighter cooperation within healthcare institutions, increased support to at-home nursing in the capital area and increased services of the National Hospital’s emergency ward and larger facilities. The response team also plans for the National Hospital to reinforce the operations of the Reykjanes peninsula, west Iceland, and South Iceland regional Healthcare institutions by assisting with test results. Processes within the National Hospital will be improved to shorten the time patients spend in the emergency ward and a part of that project is to review treatment procedures in senior care and increase other specialities’ services to patients in the emergency ward. The notice was issued on the heels of the National Hospital’s Specialist Council expressing their grave worries over the hospital’s staffing issues. The council stated that almost all professions within the hospitals were understaffed and that had a negative impact on the hospital’s services and threatened patient and staff security. Authorities were challenged to support the National hospital to ensure better services. The head of the National Hospital’s Emergency ward Már Kristjánsson welcomes the new response team and told Vísir that such extensive consultation between healthcare service providers is a novel approach. The situation at the Emergency ward remained serious, however, and the healthcare system as a whole needed extensive review before receiving increased funding. According to Már, the root of the problem is a lack of planning. Too many people seek out the emergency ward for mild illnesses that can wait, while others are stuck in emergency wards and other wards who should be in rehabilitation or nursing homes. “The lack of organisation within the National hospital leads to people seeking service in the wrong part of the system and that we haven’t been able to get people to the right place,” Már told Vísir. Improved organisation and management is one of the new response team’s main goals but increased funding for the hospital had also been discussed. Már states that improving the organisation is a priority. “I think we should maximise our output within the current system and then figure out what needs improving in regards to funding.”","Politics,Society",0,0,0,1,1,0
878,Iceland Review,"Government Approves Measures to Counteract Inflation, Overheating Economy",2022/06/12,"In lieu of raising interest rates, the government will be implementing various measures intended to counteract inflation and an overheating economy as well as reducing the treasury deficit. Vísir reports that among the changes proposed by Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson are a reduction to discounts on alcohol and tobacco products sold in airport Duty Free stores and the introduction of tariffs that will offset the current lack of revenue from vehicle and fuel taxation. The scope of the proposed measures is roughly 0.7% of the GDP, or ISK 26 billion [$1.98 million; €1.88 million]. This amount should hopefully put the treasury in good stead to decrease the deficit without needing to increase interest rates. The proposals will be elaborated in full in the 2023 budget proposal. Measures intended to increase the state’s revenue One of the biggest changes is the introduction of tariffs that are meant to offset revenue that the government has lost from vehicle and fuel taxation. This drop in revenue is attributed in part to an increase in environmentally friendly cars. As more environmentally friendly cars become the norm, it is expected that the revenue streams that the government used to enjoy from gasoline and vehicle taxes will continue to decline. As such, a simpler and more efficient revenue collection system is being developed, which corresponds to the need for continued governmental expenditure on new construction, maintenance, and operation of Icelandic roadways. Another major change will be a reduction in the tax discount on alcohol and tobacco products in Duty Free stores. Both are currently tax-free (in specific, limited quantities) when purchased, for instance, at the Keflavík airport upon entering or exiting the country. There will be a new diversion airport fee and the structure and scope of aquaculture-related VAT will be under review as well. Measures intended to cut state costs Current reductions of state-related travel expenses are to be made permanent. The leeway that exists for expenditures in the current budget will be suspended and leeway for general expenditures in policy-related areas will be almost cut in half. There will also be a reduction in contributions to political organizations.",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

Justice Minister Jón Gunnarsson’s immigration bill has been one of the most controversial, and three opposition parties have submitted proposed changes to the bill. The proposed changes submitted by the Social-Democratic Alliance, People’s Party, and Reform Party are in six parts and their aim is to reach an agreement before the end of this parliamentary session. The first change proposed is for asylum seekers whose applications have been denied continue to be provided with services until they leave the country, instead of being cut off from basic services like housing and food allowances after 30 days, as the bill currently outlines.

These proposals are now being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice. The first version of this controversial bill was introduced in Alþingi in 2018 but was not passed at the time. This is the fourth version of the bill, which has been criticised by human rights organisations each time it has been introduced. “This is an attempt by the government to establish a policy that involves significantly constricting refugees, curtailing their human rights, and reducing their possibilities for receiving protection in Iceland,” Activist Sema Erla Serdar of the aid organisation Solaris tweeted. “The bill especially targets children and other people in a particularly vulnerable situation.”",Politics,0,0,0,1,0,0

The District Public Prosecutor confirmed to Vísir that he has met twice with those in charge of investigation and prosecution and states that the investigation is progressing nicely. Read more: The Fishrot Files Two and a half years have passed since Kveikur, Stundin, and Al Jazeera Investigates cooperated with Wikileaks to shed light on what’s known as the Fishrot Files. In that media coverage, whistleblower Jóhannes Stefánsson alleged that Samherji committed bribery and tax fraud in relation to their fishing operations in Namibia. “We’ve acquired a considerable amount of data, and we’re working our way through that data and conducting interviews, although COVID-19 has hindered us in getting meetings, mostly abroad. We’ve been working on fixing that over the past few days,” District Public Prosecutor Ólafur Þór Hauksson told Vísir, confirming Stundin’s report that Icelandic investigators had met with their Namibian counterparts in the Hague last week to coordinate their efforts. Meetings have continued in Iceland over the past few days. “Most recently, there have been meetings with the parties investigating and prosecuting these cases n Namibia, and we needed to go over the situation of the case there. I can’t disclose the content of the meetings but will confirm that the meetings have taken place and been very productive.” Deputy Prime Minister of Namibia Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is in Iceland along with Namibia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Deputy Director-General Erna van der Merwe and Prosecutor General Martha Imalwa. The reason for their visit is to meet with the Icelandic investigators on the case as well as Icelandic ministers. After their meeting with the Minister of Justice’s assistant Brynjar Níelsson, he confirmed to Stundin that Namibian authorities had extended no official extradition request. Namibian investigators have asked that Namibian judicial authorities issue such a request, as extradition is a prerequisite for prosecution. No extradition treaties are in place between Namibia and Iceland, and according to legislation, Icelandic citizens can not be extradited. When asked if it was normal for an investigation to take such a long time, Ólafur stated that it’s possible when the case is extensive. “In that case, this can take a long time in Iceland and abroad. I will point out, in this context, that Namibian investigators started looking into the issue long before 2019. I believe it was in 2015 that they started looking into it.” Ólafur would not issue a timeframe for prosecution but repeated that the investigation was progressing satisfactorily.","Business,Politics,Society",1,0,0,1,1,0

882,Iceland Review,Excavation in Seyðisfjörður Unearths Jewelry from Earliest Period of Settlement,2022/08/09,"Archaeologists in Seyðisfjörður have excavated jewelry that dates from 940 – 1100, just after the initial settlement of Iceland. Notably, one of the beads found in the excavation even bears the colours of the Icelandic national flag. Archaeological digs have been underway in Seyðisfjörður, a fishing village in the East Fjords of Iceland, since 2020. Due to the high slopes of the valley, Seyðisfjörður is subject to land slides, and local authorities plan to build defensive barriers to protect the village, which has suffered damage in recent years. However, these same land slides have also preserved archaeological sites in the region particularly well. Archaeologists have been called in to perform exploratory digs where the defensive barriers will be erected, and have found remarkably intact manmade structures and artifacts such as game pieces and pearls. The most recent discoveries are centered around the farmstead where Bjólfur, a settler named in Landnámabók, is believed to have had his farmstead. Significant finds at this site have included the remains of a man, a horse, a spear, and a boat. Archaeologists have been able to date the site with a fair amount of accuracy, given tephra layers from eruptions, and land slide layers. The artifact that has generated the most interest by far has been a bead which coincidentally has the colours of the Icelandic flag: blue, white, and red. Ragnheiður Traustadóttir, an archaeologist and director of the team, has stated to RÚV that the find has caused quite the stir on social media, even causing some to claim a more recent provenance. However, Ragnheiður has stated that it is certainly from the period 940 – 1100, given that it was found under known tephra and land slide layers. “It will be interesting to put this in context with the four mounds we dug up last year,” she said to RÚV.  “There is a unique opportunity to look at the history of Seyðisfjörður from the second half of the tenth century until the eleventh century.” Some twenty archaeologists are currently at work excavating in Seyðisfjörður. The field season is expected to last through the middle of August, and continue next year.  ","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
883,Iceland Review,“Beauty of Freedom:” Reykjavík Pride Festival Begins,2022/08/02,"Reykjavík’s annual Pride Festival officially kicks off today with a rainbow-painting event on Bankastræti in the city centre. The festival lasts until Sunday, August 7 and its events include karaoke nights, lectures, drag storytime, and of course the traditional Pride Parade on Saturday, August 6. According to the Director of the National Queer Association of Iceland (Samtökin ’78), educating the public is a crucial step in tackling the backlash that has occurred in the fight for equal rights. The theme of this year’s festival is “Beauty of Freedom,” a phrase borrowed from Iceland’s 2022 Eurovision entry Með hækkandi sól. “After the long isolation of the last years, we now have the freedom to gather together and unite once more in solidarity. Finally we have the freedom to celebrate our victories and stand together in the fight for human rights, awareness and equality,” a post on the Reykjavík Pride website states. While the freedom of LGBTQI+ people has “expanded over the course of the last years and decades,” the post states, “we still haven’t reached the highest degree of true freedom. Some groups within the queer community are still struggling and every day, their freedom and beauty is questioned, both in Iceland and abroad.” Repeated acts of vandalism to a rainbow painted outside a Reykjavík church, hateful anonymous letters, and even comments from authorities about LGBTQIA+ asylum seekers are just a few examples of prejudice towards the queer community that have appeared in Icelandic media in recent weeks. Daníel Arnarsson, director of the National Queer Association of Iceland says prejudice against the LGBTQIA+ community has increased and become more commonplace. “When we allow prejudice to fester, we are also opening the door for that prejudice to spread to other minority groups,” Daníel told RÚV, emphasising that educating the public about the reality faced by queer people is key in fighting what he called a backlash in the LGBTQIA+ rights movement. All are welcome to take part in the rainbow painting at noon today at the corner of Bankastræti and Ingólfssstræti. The full festival programme is available on the Reykjavík Pride website.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0
884,Iceland Review,West Iceland Pride Festival This Weekend,2022/07/23,"This weekend marks the second annual West Iceland Pride Festival. RÚV reports that the festival, which will take place in Ólafsvík, Grundarfjörður, and Rif, will include a parade, a picnic, and a ball headlined by gay icon Páll Óskar, and is intended to increase LGBTQIA+ visibility outisde of the capital area. Alexander Aron Guðjónsson, one of the festival organizers, says that the West Iceland Pride Festival is here to stay. Last year’s celebration was held in the town of Borgarnes, and “was the biggest town festival that had ever been held [there].” He added that well over a thousand people took part in the Pride parade. “We plan to go all over the west—Borgarnes last year, [the municipality of] Snæfellsbær this year, and tomorrow, we’ll announce where we’re going next year.” It’s important that the voices of LGBTQIA+ people are heard all over Iceland, Alexander Aron continued. “We hear this so often from people…Just now, a man came into our shop here to buy a flag to wave, and he was saying that this is kind of a male-dominated society that sometimes isn’t super open, such that you can see all its diversity. So it’s great to come here and show people who are in the closet and don’t dare come out because they’re afraid to […]: there are people like them here in the West and they are visible and want to be, they want to be loud and speak up about who they are.” Pride Parade on Saturday The festival’s main event, the Pride Parade, will take place in Ólafsvík on Saturday at 2:00pm. The parade will begin at Ólafsbraut 66, head down the street, and turn up Kirkjutún before ending at Sjómannagarðurinn (‘The Sailors’ Park’). Per the organizers, “We celebrate diversity and will ALL walk together in support of LGBTQIA+ people’s fight for their rights.” Drag Queen Miss Agatha P. Meðal will host festivities in the park after the parade, including live music and a Queer as Hell Disco with DJ AlexanderAron from 10pm – 1am.

885,Iceland Review,"New English Translation Inspires ‘Rediscovery’ of Halldór Laxness, Iceland’s Nobel Laureate",2022/07/17,"Halldór Laxness, Iceland’s virtuosic Nobel Laureate in Literature, is having something of a renaissance in the United States, reports The New Yorker. The revival has been a long one, with the novelist’s early success in America stymied by those opposed to his outspoken political beliefs—not least nefarious FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Slowly but surely, however, Halldór is starting to get his due in the US. The revival started in the late 90s, when authors such as Brad Leithauser, Jane Smiley, and Susan Sontag voiced their unfettered enthusiasm for novels such as Independent People. But most recently, this much-delayed appreciation is thanks to the publication of Salka Valka in Philip Roughton’s translation, which Salvatore Scibona hails as “a gripping wonder, and [Halldór’s] most sustained piece of narrative drama.” The wide-ranging profile traces Halldór’s remarkable life, which could easily be the stuff of fiction itself. He was raised on a farm called Laxnes in 1902 and died in a Reykjavík nursing home in 1998. In between, he contracted and recovered from polio; spent as many as ten hours a day writing as a child; finished his first novel, some 600 pages long, at 16; travelled extensively; was a voracious polyglot (besides his native Icelandic, Halldór spoke Danish, English, and German, and spent time studying Russian, Latin, and French); almost took orders as a Benedictine monk; tried to make it as a Hollywood screenwriter; became disillusioned with America and capitalism after the start of the Great Depression in 1929; became an outspoken socialist, advocate for Icelandic independence from Denmark, and anti-NATO activist; was probably blacklisted in the US for his political beliefs and definitely investigated by J. Edgar Hoover; and, of course, became Iceland’s first—and as yet only—Nobel laureate at the age of 53 for a body of work that the prize committee lauded for “renew[ing] the great narrative art of Iceland.” (And that’s just the short version—The Islander, Halldór Guðmundsson’s biography of Halldór Laxness, also translated by Philip Roughton, is nearly 500 pages long.) Salka Valka, published by Archipelago Books, began its life as Halldór’s doomed Hollywood screenplay. At the time, it carried at the time the subtitle “A Woman in Pants.” Halldór envisioned Greta Garbo for the lead role. However, the studio wanted to move the setting from Iceland to Kentucky, and that was an adjustment that Halldór could not accept. So he returned to Iceland and turned his screenplay into a novel, which was published in two parts in 1931 and 1932. The eponymous main character is a heroine ahead of her time, a trouser-wearing, deep-voiced, stridently independent, politically passionate woman of “unruly vitality” who will not be dominated or subjugated by men, society, or even love. Notably, Philip Roughton’s translation is the first English version of the novel to be translated directly from Icelandic. A previous English version of the novel, published in 1936, was translated not from Icelandic but from Danish, yielding a final product that Halldór did not like at all, complaining that “fifty per cent of my style has disappeared.” Roughton’s new version, on the other hand, “moves along with calm assurance,” writes Scibona, “tossing off Laxness’s inventive and always spot-on descriptions as though they were commonplace” and “captur[ing] Laxness’s singular dour-droll tone with uncanny grace.” Read the full profile of Halldór Laxness and more about Salka Valka (in English) here.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
886,Iceland Review,From the Archives: The 1972 World Chess Championship in Iceland,2022/07/12,"On July 11, 1972, Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky met in Reykjavík for the 1972 World Chess Championship. The match, lasting 6 weeks, took place in Laugardalshöll and was one of the first major chess tournaments to be televised. It was much more than just a chess match, however. Fischer’s victory over Spassky ended a decades-long monopoly the Soviet Union held over the international chess scene. At a time when the tensions of the Cold War seemed to be lessening, the match represented a reescalation of East v. West chess diplomacy. Fischer was especially notorious for his flamboyant character and personal excesses, even at one point refusing to play because the prize money wasn’t enough. Where the Soviet chess school emphasized their dominance as a victory of their system, Fischer represented Western greed and egotism, but also genius and creativity. During its close to 60 years of publishing history, Iceland Review has covered major milestones in Icelandic history. Here, we revisit our original coverage of this historic match, written by Gísli Sigurðsson that thrust Iceland onto the world stage.  “Now began the intermezzo, the real war of nerves. Bobby Fischer failed to arrive in Iceland, and the days slipped by. He had been seen in New York, and it became known that Kissinger himself, Nixon’s righthand man, had been called in to induce Bobby to come to Iceland for the good of the country.” “Fischer was like a man who does not dare to take the plunge. So somebody had to give him a push. A wealthy chess fan in Britain quite unexpectedly stepped into the breach. He offered to double the prize money, and Fischer could himself decide whether the victor was to receive all of it or to share it. ‘A magnanimous gesture,’ said Fischer, adding that now he had no option but to go to Iceland.” “When the challenger failed to appear in the afternoon, a press conference was held. Dr. Max Euwe, President of the International Chess Federation, was very depressed. ‘I have two alternatives’, he said, ‘One is to cancel this match here and now. The other is to postpone it for two days’. Dr. Euwe chose the second alternative, to a great extent out of sympathy for the Icelandic Chess Federation, which had been put to much expense and trouble. The atmosphere was dismal; people were convinced that the whole thing was off.” “But Fischer arrived at the eleventh hour, or maybe a little later. He hurried out of the plane into the car, rather like a hijacker expecting a hail of police bullets. The war of nerves was at its height, and Fischer seemed to be a bundle of nerves. He had come to fulfil an old promise — to beat the Russians. Now they had the next move: No match unless Fischer makes a formal apology. Much to everyone’s surprise this was soon forthcoming: ‘Dear Boris. Please accept my heartfelt apologies for my indecent behaviour by not attending the inaugural ceremony.'” “The air was full of tension in the hall on Tuesday, 11th July. The world champion appeared exactly on the minute and played his first move. The clock ran for seven minutes. Then at last Fischer stalked onto the stage. People relaxed. And immediately in this game the challenger’s aggressiveness was revealed; people expected a very complicated position to develop with such chessmasters. But Fischer took all the pieces it was possible to take. However, in the 29th move he bit off more than he could chew. This was Fischer’s most serious slip in the whole match. That move cost him the first game.” “The world champion maintained his dignity and sat down punctually to the second game. Time passed, and people became restless. The challenger did not appear. Then it became known that he did not intend to do so, and Fridrik Olafsson, Icelandic Grandmaster, tried to save the situation by talking to him in his hotel room, but he was not to be moved. People once more became pessimistic. The match appeared to have reached an impasse, and Fischer had even booked a flight back to America. The arbiters awarded a win to Boris Spassky in the second game.” “The difference in the behaviour of the contestants was obvious. Spassky brought to mind an Olympian champion athlete when he walked in; he sat perfectly straight in his seat, always calm, looking relaxed, and he considered the situation from a certain distance. Fischer, on the other hand, shambled onto the stage in great strides; his gait was uneven, and his clothes always seemed to be crumpled.” “But the dramatic moment when the world champion laid down his King for the last time never arrived. Instead, Boris Spassky telephoned to the arbiter. He seemed to be very tired. He would surrender the 21 st game, he said.” “Robert James Fischer received this news quietly. While the audience applauded as never before, he signed something for the arbiter, then strode out into the rain where his bodyguard was awaiting the new world champion who had finally beaten the Russians. It was a smiling Bobby Fischer who took a dip in one of Reykjavik’s swimming pools that night with the World Press on his heels. ‘Iceland is a great country, I like it here.'”","Archive,Culture",0,1,0,0,0,0
887,Iceland Review,‘It’s Mostly Foreigners Who Take an Interest in Turf Houses’,2022/07/10,"An engineer in East Iceland is passing down ancestral methods of turf construction, Austurfrétt reports. Þorvaldur P. Hjarðar has a great deal of experience with these ancient building techniques, having recently restored two turf outbuildings and one turf sheep shed on his farm, Hjarðarhagi í Jökudal. “There aren’t a lot of folks who are up for such specialized courses, but seven people were interested in participating and so now we’re just about to finish rebuilding an old, turf smokehouse which must, of course, be consecrated by smoking some lamb and singing the old songs,” said Þorvaldur. His course focused on methods of building turf structures that are unique to the East Fjords. “Not many people know this, actually, but there were a number of unique things about the turf houses here in the East. Foremost that the masonry on most of them is cabled, as it’s termed. That’s to say that they alternated between layers of turf and stone. This isn’t unheard of elsewhere but it’s very prominent here in the East. It was done a lot here because there weren’t a lot of good stones in most places out here.” Þorvaldur says that Icelanders even have their own prosciutto, though it’s a luxury good that has yet to be capitalized on. “So, the thing is, that in the old days, all hangikjöt [smoked lamb] was double-smoked in smokehouses made from turf and that hangikjöt is much different from the processed kind we get in Icelandic supermarkets today. The meat is much firmer and the flavour a lot milder. It is, to my mind, the only real Icelandic delicacy, but no one’s running with this historical tradition. We lose our minds over prosciutto in Italy or Jamón Ibérico in Spain. But we’d have an entirely comparable product here in this country, if we just smoked it in an old-fashioned turf house.” Þorvaldur says he’s found there’s a growing interest in Icelandic turf houses, but this interest is by far the greatest among foreign tourists. “There’s certainly a growing interest, but maybe least of all among Icelanders,” he mused. “It doesn’t make any sense because we tend to go see old buildings when we ourselves are traveling abroad, but we care almost nothing about our own remarkable history and houses. And no one should be in any doubt that Icelandic turf houses are magnificent in every way.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
888,Iceland Review,Mittens Long in the National Museum of Iceland’s Archive Dated to Settlement Era,2022/07/06,"When Halldór Kristjánsson, a farmer from Akranes, dug new foundations for his farm in 1960, he unearthed a pair of mittens that have since sat in the collection of the National Museum. Kristján Eldjárn, then the head conservationist and future president of Iceland, suspected that the mittens dated from the earliest period in Iceland’s history. His suspicion had gone unconfirmed until now, when a study conducted by researchers at the National Museum verified their antiquity. Last spring, a sample from the Heynes mittens, named after the farm on which they were discovered, was sent abroad to a lab for analysis. Two samples were taken, one from the mittens themselves, and one from a braided cord that connects the mittens. The results of the dating show that both the mittens and cord are from the second half of the 10th century, placing them before the Christianization of Iceland. Notably, they are also an example of early sewing techniques for clothing, as knitting was not used in Iceland until the 1500s. Earlier this year, Scandinavian textile experts conducted research at the National Museum of Iceland. They concluded that if the mittens did indeed date from the settlement period, their pristine condition could make them nearly unique as artefacts in the North Atlantic. The mittens are made from homespun wool, a staple fabric during the settlement of Iceland. Their remarkable preservation is attributed to their burial in the earth under the farmstead at Heynes. The mittens, known as Þjms. 1960-77, can be viewed online at the National Museum of Iceland’s digital archive. The mittens are also on display at the National Museum, which is open from 10.00 to 17.00 every day of the week.    ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

892,Iceland Review,Intact Walls from an 11th Century Turf House Found in Seyðisfjörður,2022/06/28,"The undamaged walls of a manmade structure dating back to the 11th century have been found in an archaeological dig in Seyðisfjörður, East Iceland. RÚV reports that the walls are in such good condition because they were buried by a landslide that occurred around 1150. “We’ve uncovered a number of structures or houses that seem to be under the landslide from 1150,” explained archaeologist Ragnheiður Traustadóttir. “So it’s just really exciting, what we’re starting to see here.” Uncovering the ruins is an ongoing process, Ragnheiður said, “but we’ve got some exciting weeks ahead.” There are plans in the works to build landslide barriers in Seyðisfjörður to protect the town, which has been subjected to a number of devastating mud- and landslides in recent years. So this summer, as during the previous two, archaeologists have been working to uncover and preserve whatever artefacts they may find in advance of this construction. A number of smaller artefacts were found last summer, some of which dated back to the earliest settlement of Iceland. The landslide from 1150 was discovered last autumn, and beneath it, four pagan graves. Ragnheiður says this discovery changed the course of the dig, prompting the archaeologists to investigate the area under the landslide more closely. “What is perhaps the most interesting is that the landslide doesn’t appear to have damaged these houses,” she said. “Maybe it had lost all momentum by the time it had made it down here, to the settlement, and so just piled up along the turf walls and hills and so now we’re digging out unusually intact turf walls.” Ragnheiður told Iceland Review that researchers are just beginning to uncover the structures at this time, but expect to eventually find even older artefacts, dating back to the time of settlement (9th century). The dig will continue until mid-August.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
893,Iceland Review,Simple Stories for Icelandic Learners – Sequel to Árstíðir Released,2022/06/13,"Author Karítas Hrundar Pálsdóttur has released her second book of short stories for Icelandic learners in Reykjavík. Titled Dagatal – sögur á einföldu máli (Calendar – Stories in Easy Language), the book is intended to help adult Icelandic learners by exposing them to everyday situations in Iceland in a straightforward and engaging way. Dagatal is a follow-up of sorts to Karítas’ first book Árstíðir (Seasons). In addition to being a helpful tool in the language learning process, Karítas says she hopes the book’s stories reflect the values of equality and diversity. “I felt there was a need for more books in simple language, based on my own language learning experiences and also as a teacher of Icelandic as a second language,” Karítas told Iceland Review. When I started teaching and met more people that were learning Icelandic, I began to see what sort of material was missing.” Dagatal is not a continuation of Árstíðir per se. While Karítas’ first book provides stories at the A2-B1 language levels according to the European framework, the stories in Dagatal have a slightly broader range of difficulty: A2-B2. The level is determined based on factors including vocabulary, grammar, and content. Karítas says that while Icelandic language education in Iceland has made great strides in recent years, a lot more could be done. “I feel the development has been good, all things considered, but we’re behind compared to the Nordic countries in terms of teaching the national language to immigrants. Then, of course, it would be good to see more funding from the government and employers because immigrants don’t always have the time or money to learn Icelandic.” In addition to being a language-learning tool, Karítas worked to ensure that Dagatal reflects the values of diversity and equality. “In the stories, I try to challenge the idea of ‘women’s’ and ‘men’s’ jobs, for example. I depict all kinds of families and relationships, including same-sex partnerships and blended families with stepparents. One of the characters uses the gender-neutral pronoun hán (they). The aim was to show the breadth of society: what Iceland has achieved and where it is headed.” The publication received a grant from Jafnréttisstjóður Íslands (The Icelandic Equality Fund).",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

895,Iceland Review,Unpublished Poem by Davíð Stefánsson Discovered,2022/05/27,"A 19-verse poem by celebrated poet Davíð Stefánsson has been discovered. The piece could be among the very first poems that Davíð composed. Last weekend, Fréttablaðið reported that a previously unpublished poem by the popular Icelandic poet and novelist Davíð Stefánsson (who is best known for his volumes of poetry) had likely been discovered; the style of the poem and the handwriting offer a strong indication of its origin. “We believe that Davíð composed the poem during his school years,” Haraldur Þór Egilsson, curator of the Akureyri Museum, told Fréttablaðið. “It was probably written before Svartar fjaðrir (Black Feathers) was published.” (Svartar Fjaðrir, Black Feathers, was Davíð Stefánsson’s first book of poetry, published in 1919. As noted on the website of the Akureyri Museum, the book was “accorded immediate acclaim and established the young author’s reputation. His poems captured the feelings and longings of the general public in crisp, clear and picturesque writing.”) The recently discovered poem is entitled A Brief Story and is addressed to Davíð’s childhood friend, Helga Gunnlaugsdóttir of Ytri Reistará, to whom the poet was very close. Having allowed experts to inspect the poem, Haraldur believes that there is no doubt that it was composed by Davíð. “It smacks of a poem written by a novice, but there’s a wistfulness to it, the experts say, that evokes the spirit of Davíð,” Haraldur noted. The poem was in the possession of Helga’s son, Stefán Lárus Árnason, for many years before Stefán’s daughters, five in all, gifted the poem to the Davíð Stefánsson Museum in Akureyri earlier this month. “The poem isn’t perfect, and perhaps he wouldn’t have published it himself without having perfected it,” Haraldur continued in his interview with Fréttablaðið. He then went on to encourage anyone in possession of a similar work to share it with the museum. “If anyone is sitting on a poem, which they believe may have been written by Davíð, then they can, of course, turn to us; Davíð was known to send poems to friends and acquaintances for comment, so who knows if the original versions of some of his poems, e.g. Black Feathers, remain in possession of some of their relatives.”  ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
896,Iceland Review,"Viking-Era Cave System Larger, Older Than Previously Thought",2022/05/27,"Ongoing excavations of Viking-era, man-made caves near Oddi in South Iceland have revealed an extensive system of interconnected structures that is not only much larger than originally thought, but also much older. Mbl.is reports that excavations, substantiated by tephra layers, show that the caves at Oddi were first dug out in the middle of the 10th century. “There really are no words to describe it,” archeologist Kristborg Þórsdóttir said of the experience of standing in what is one of the best-preserved man-made structures of the Viking era. Kristborg is leading the current interdisciplinary study on the caves, which has been ongoing since 2020. “The size of these structures is just so vast, there hasn’t been a study of such large structures, and definitely not from this time period in Iceland.” An important medieval cultural and political centre The first intact, man-made cave at Oddi was discovered in 2018, which was a remarkable discovery in and of itself. But further investigation of the site revealed a much larger cave connected to the first. It is this cave that is currently being excavated by Kristborg and her team. The historic site of a church, farm, and vicarage, Oddi was once one of Iceland’s most important cultural and political seats and home to a powerful clan known as the Oddverjar. The current study has been ongoing for two years, with the primary aim of shedding light on the writing culture that was there during the 11th and 12th centuries, when the Oddverjar were at the height of their powers. Sæmundur fróði (Sæmundur the Learned, 1056-1133) was the most famous member of the clan. He studied in France and wrote one of the earliest histories of the Norwegian kings, although that manuscript was lost. Sæmundur’s grandson, Jón Loftsson, was a powerful chieftain who fostered Snorri Sturluson, the renowned historian, poet, and lawspeaker who is thought to have authored or partially authored major medieval works such as the Prose Edda (known as Snorri’s Edda in Icelandic), the most significant extant source on Norse mythology, as well as the Heimskringla, a saga of the Norwegian kings that was likely based on Sæmundur fróði’s lost manuscript. A race against time  “We’ve just partially opened up the large, collapsed cave that our little cave is connected to,” explained Kristborg. “We still have deeper to dig; we’re just working on making conditions safe. It’s gotten very deep and the rock isn’t sound. So it’s taken some time.” Kristborg notes that the excavation is unique in terms of how demanding on-site conditions are. The caves are not only at a significant depth, which is dangerous for the archaeologists involved in digging them out, but also built into sandstone. “The rock is so porous that it just crumbles before our eyes.” It’s thought that the caves were not used for very long because they are so prone to disintegration. Resources for the archeologists also remain limited. “We only have limited funds and time and you never know what’s going to happen next year. Maybe we can continue, maybe not. And information is always lost from year to year, preservation gets worse.” A long and complex history, waiting to be uncovered Kristborg says that the cave currently being excavated may possibly be Nautahellir, Bull Cave, which is mentioned in Jarteinabók Þorláks Biskups (Bishop Þorlákur’s Legends of Saints), which dates back to 1210 – 1250. The manuscript relates how Nautahellir collapsed with 12 bulls in it. One was then rescued from the rubble. “Although it’s older than that, it’s likely that [the cave] was used for livestock,” explained Kristborg. “Whether it was for that specific bull, we don’t know. But the history of its use obviously goes back further than we’ve managed to trace yet.” The caves at Oddi have a complex and fascinating story to tell, says Kristborg, but the scope of the current investigation is such that she and her team need to keep their focus narrow. “These are huge structures and an unbelievably large system of caves that we’re only just starting to come to grips with. […] We’d need to undertake a much, much larger study with a much bigger crew in order to get to the bottom of this and trace this history in full, the history of these caves’ use.” ",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
897,Iceland Review,"Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Welcomed Icelandic Delegation",2022/05/24,"A delegation of Icelanders, including President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, met with representatives of tech giants Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in the US last week to discuss the incorporation of the Icelandic language into new technologies. In a television interview, Guðni stated that the meetings went well, with the corporations willing to increase collaboration with Icelandic language technology developers to ensure Icelandic could be used widely in the digital world. The Icelandic delegation met with Scott Guthrie, Executive Vice President of the Cloud and AI group in Microsoft. They expressed their thanks for Microsoft’s inclusion of the Icelandic language in their software, including Word, which is available in Icelandic. Guthrie revealed to the delegation that he is a big fan of Icelandic Nordic noir author Arnaldur Indriðason and has read most of his books. President of Iceland Guðni Th. Jóhannesson stated that in the future, speaking to devices will be our main way of interacting with them: “and not just to ask our phone what time it is or what the capital of Costa Rica is, or something along those lines, rather this technology will be used in the healthcare sector, education, and so much more.” Read More: Improving the Icelandic Language on Devices The aim of the trip was to ensure that the technological developments that take place take the Icelandic language into account. The delegation was not on its knees, begging for that to happen, Guðni says, rather showed up armed with arguments and data about the importance of linguistic inclusion in the tech world. “We went to these technology giants with that in our suitcase and said: we’re going to work together,” Guðni stated. “We are going to invite you to cooperate and luckily we were well received everywhere.” Read more about the newest developments in Icelandic language technology.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0

901,Iceland Review,Sóley and Bára Nominated for Nordic Council Music Prize,2022/05/11,"Icelandic musicians Sóley Stefánsdóttir (above) and Bára Gísladóttir (below) have been nominated for the 2022 Nordic Council Music Prize. This year’s nominees represent a wide range of genres from world music and opera to electronic music. Sóley has been nominated for her 2021 album Mother Melancholia. In their rationale, the jury describes the album as “a work of the utmost originality, in reality one long meditation on the state of the world, gravitating between pretty and horrific.” In an interview with Iceland Review Sóley described Mother Melancholia as being about apocalypse. “We can’t really imagine what happens at the end of the world. It’s an abstract idea. Especially when you live here in Iceland and have your house and your computer and your day-to-day life. I’ve been reading some dystopian Margret Atwood novels and thinking ‘wow, maybe it’ll be like this.’ Maybe that’s the role of artists: to create, draw, paint, try to imagine it.” Bára Gísladóttir is a double bassist and composer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was nominated for her piece VÍDDIR, written for nine flutes, percussion, double bass, and electric bass. The Nordic Council Music Prize jury called her compositions “highly creative and uncompromising,” calling VÍDDIR an “enthralling” work where Bára “shapes the sounds and structure of the music in an organic way with focus on textural and timbral progressions through various portals of possibilities of the instruments.” The winner of the Nordic Council Music Prize will be announced on November 1 in Helsinki, Finland.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

904,Iceland Review,“Wind Harp” Sculpture Unveiled at Harpa Concert Hall,2022/05/06,"Himinglæva is the name of a new stainless-steel sculpture by Elín Hansdóttir that will be officially unveiled outside of Harpa Concert Hall tomorrow. It’s a work of art that is not only meant to be seen, but also heard. An “Aeolian harp,” the sculpture is designed to produce sonic overtones as the wind travels through it. Its name comes from Norse mythology, and means “transparent, shining, and small wave.” In Norse mythology, sailors who sensed the power of the wind and waves around them assumed that the mythical figure Himinglæva was embodying the water and propelling their vessels across the ocean. Alluding metaphorically to this legend, the harp is designed to attune the viewer to the natural forces around them. The shape is based on a Lissajous figure, representing the shape of light beams reflected through vibrating tuning forks. The sounds it produces change based on the force of the wind travelling through it. The sculpture has been a long time in the making: back in 2008, before Harpa was completed, a design competition was held for public art in the environs of the concert hall. Himinglæva was the winning entry. Funding priorities shifted following the banking collapse, but thanks to a monetary gift from the City of Reykjavík and the state given to Harpa last year, the concert hall could finally fund the construction of Elín’s design. Elín’s work often involves visual distortions that heighten the viewer’s awareness of their own presence in relation to the artwork. Himinglæva plays with sonic distortions instead, exploring how a sculpture can filter the natural environment around it. Iceland’s Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir and Mayor of Reykjavík Dagur B. Eggertsson will be present at the sculpture’s unveiling in front of Harpa at 4:00 PM tomorrow. Elín is currently completing a residency in Berlin, but will travel to Iceland for the unveiling of Himinglæva.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

The festival will include social events for players, presentations, and hangouts with the game’s developers. It’s been four years since the last fanfest was held. “The city is starting to fill up with, well, some would call them nerds,” stated Eldar Ástþórsson somewhat cheekily in a RÚV interview earlier today. Eldar is the brand manager of CCP Games, the video game developer that created EVE Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) renowned for its scale and complexity. The game currently boasts over 1 million players per month. Eldar says participants have come from all over the world. “[Fanfest] is a festival, conference, and national assembly, because these are players in the EVE universe, which is huge, that come here to have fun and meet others, but also to talk about economic, historical, and political issues in the EVE universe.” EVE Online was first released in 2003, almost 20 years ago. “At CCP, we’re really proud that this game has lived for so long, and we’re also very proud of EVE Fanfest and the concept around it. We were one of the first companies to invite our customers, the people who play the game, to this sort of party.

This will not be Hlynur’s first time at the prestigious film festival; in 2019 his film A White, White Day screened during Critics’ Week and earned actor Ingvar Sigurðsson the rising star award. Set in the 19th century, Godland tells the story of a young Danish priest (Elliott Crosset Hove) who “travels to a remote part of Iceland to build a church and photograph its people. But the deeper he goes into the unforgiving landscape, the more he strays from his purpose, his mission and morality.” It is a co-production between Denmark’s Snowglobe film production company and Iceland’s Join Motion Picture.

The winning photo, seen above, was taken by Vilhjálmur Gunnarson, and features, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Geldingadalir eruption, which began in March and lasted until September of 2021. The jury described the photo as “An interesting, strong and original picture of one of the biggest news stories in a challenging year.” Vilhjálmur also won in the category of News Photo of the Year, for the above photo, titled “Where is Svandís?” The shot features Iceland’s new cabinet following the September 2021 parliamentary elections setting up for a group photo, with Minister of Food and Agriculture Svandís Svavarsdóttir nowhere to be found. The jury praised its humorous take on a classic subject. Kristinn Magnússon won in the category of Sports Photo of the Year, for this capture of a tender moment where Deane William’s girlfriend comforts him after his team has lost a game, while the winning team celebrates in the background. This colourful shot by Hörður Sveinsson, featuring musician John Grant, was the winner in the Magazine Photo of the Year category. The jury praised its powerful colours and unusual shapes, which the photographer and subject clearly put a lot of effort into. Like the winning Photo of the Year, the winner in the Environment category, taken by Sigtryggur Ari Jóhannsson, also features the Geldingadalir eruption, though in a different light. The jury noted how the image appears black and white, but a closer look reveals subtle colours. The shot shows fresh lava about to flow over earthen dams, built to direct the flow of the eruption.  Photographer Heiða Helgadóttir snapped a winner when she captured Una Margrét Jónsdóttir and Hólmsteinn Eiður Hólmsteinsson, married for 20 years, using a special form of communication that has helped them discuss difficult issues throughout their relationships: letting imaginary “finger people” discuss the topics on their behalf. Páll Stefánsson won the Portrait of the Year category for his shot of artist Shu Yi at the opening of her exhibition at Mutt Gallery last year. The jury praised the photo for its stylistic purity and calm but strong energy. Heiða Helgadóttir shot this year’s winning series, which features Pétur Guðmann Guðmannsson, one of Iceland’s two professional forensic pathologists. All the autopsies Pétur carries out have the goal of determining the individual’s cause of death. The jury praised Heiða for her well-thought-out approach, and for portraying difficult subject matter in a way that was tasteful and professional, while still striking. The exhibition features 102 photos in total, and can be seen at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography until May 29, 2022.

913,Iceland Review,Impostor Syndrome: Fake Artists Posing as Icelandic Musicians on Spotify,2022/04/03,"Minister of Culture Lilja Alfreðsdóttir will meet with the CEO of Spotify this week to discuss the proliferation of “fake artists” posing as Icelandic musicians on the music streaming platform, RÚV reports. She says Spotify has thus far ignored requests to remove the impostors, which is costing real Icelandic artists a substantial amount of potential revenue. During the meeting, Lilja intends to discuss the seriousness of this matter with the streaming service and fight for real Icelandic musicians to get the exposure and revenue they deserve. “The whole landscape has changed so much with streaming services and this can be a positive thing in some ways, but there are negative sides, too, and this is clearly one of them,” she said. “I believe our musicians deserve more for their efforts and I intend to say so. I understand that people think Iceland is cool, but this [appreciation] can’t be [performed] in such a way that our musicians’ earnings go down. That’s out of the question, in my mind.” The Swedish Connection The phenomenon of so-called ‘fake artists’ on Spotify has caused considerable consternation within the international music scene for years. Fake artists are the inventions of a small number of individual music producers and/or record companies that create untraceable pseudonyms with little-to-no digital footprint, and then mass-produce songs that are added to Spotify’s popular playlists. Playlists encourage song play and Spotify revenues are, of course, paid according to the number of plays an artist receives. Therefore, fake artists funnel streaming profits to a select few entities and deprive actual working musicians of their already scant streaming royalties. A recent report by Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter discovered that Firefly Entertainment, a Swedish record label whose management appears to have close personal ties with a former Spotify executive, boasts a roster of over 800 fake artists, nearly 500 of whom are found on key Spotify playlists. Per Music Business Worldwide: “DN also discovered–via the register of Swedish publishing body STIM–that music from over 500 of these “fake artists” have been created by just 20 songwriters. The publication says it even found one composer who is the creator of songs for no less than 62 fake artists on Spotify; his music is currently attracting 7.7 million listeners on the service each month.” (Read Music Business Worldwide’s latest reporting on this developing story, in English, here.) RÚV reports that a number of Firefly Entertainment’s fake artists are reputedly Icelandic. These Icelandic impostors then appear on a number of Iceland-themed playlists and thereby cash in on the country’s cachet as a nature- and music-lover’s paradise. Ekfat the Fake “Icelandic Beatmaker” One particularly egregious example of Firefly’s undercover antics is a fake artist going by the moniker Ekfat, whose song “Polar Circle” has generated over 3.52 million listens. According to the artist bio on Spotify, Ekfat is the pseudonym of “upcoming Icelandic beatmaker” Guðmundur Gunnarsson, who has been “part of the legendary Smekkleysa Lo-Fi Rockers crew since 2017.” But in reality, no such musician exists and neither does his “legendary crew,” although Smekkleysa Lo-Fi Rockers is undoubtedly a play on the real (and actually iconic) Smekkleysa SM, or Bad Taste Records, which launched Björk’s career, among others. And yet, until recently, Ekfat could apparently be found on the Spotify-created playlist “Lo-Fi House.” (At time of writing, Spotify showed that Ekfat was supposed to be featured on this playlist, but no song by the artist appears on the playlist anymore.) Real Icelandic Music from Real Icelandic Artists Luckily for Icelandic music enthusiasts, there’s an easy way to find and support real Icelandic musicians on Spotify. Iceland Music, an organization that promotes and exports music from Iceland, has created a number of playlists on both Spotify and Apple Music, all of which are populated with verified songs and musicians from Iceland. These include a playlist of new music from Iceland, which is updated on a weekly basis, as well as playlists of ‘atmospheric’ songs, contemporary classical music, music by Icelandic women, Icelandic hip hop, metal, electronic, and more. (Icelandic artists who want to have their music added to these verified playlists can request so here.) More on Icelandic musicians and streaming platforms in our latest issue.",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0

917,Iceland Review,Two Additional Film Studios to Rise in Reykjavík,2022/03/16,"Reykjavík Studios Purchases a 4,000 square metre building in the Gufunes district of Reykjavík yesterday in which the company plans to build two state-of-the-art film studios, RÚV reports. Director Baltasar Kormákur says that when renovations are completed, it will be possible to film blockbusters like Harry Potter in Iceland. The project is expected to cost around ISK 1 billion, [$7.7 million; €7 million], and Baltasar hopes it will be completed by the end of the year. Baltasar’s production company Reykjavík Studios has made a name for itself with many successful television series and films, including Trapped and Katla. The company already has a studio next door to the purchased building, where this year’s Söngvakeppnin competition was filmed. That studio is one of the largest in Europe, and too big for certain projects, according to Baltasar, which is why the new building will be split into two smaller film studios. “There will be a sound-proof wall between them, and there will be two smaller studios that will be more useful for the Icelandic film industry than [our other studio].” The new studios could also house concerts and events, Baltasar says, but there is much work to be done before that will be possible. “I’m hoping I can put it to use this year,” Baltasar stated. “We are ready to go all-in into construction.” The studio’s success depends on the government fulfilling its promises regarding reimbursement of film production costs. The current government policy provides a 25% reimbursement of all filming production costs incurred in Iceland, both for local and international production companies.","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0

Several markings have been used over the years to state the origin of various Icelandic products, but Islenskt will roll out the new label out across all packaging in the coming months. The goal of the initiative is to create consistency and certainty in a time when consumers are more discerning about the origin of their food. Milk, meat, eggs, seafood and flowers that are produced and packaged 100% in Iceland can bear the new logo. Blended products like yoghurt and cheese can be labelled as Icelandic origin if no more than 25% of their ingredients are imported.","Culture,Society",0,1,0,0,1,0

921,Iceland Review,Damon Albarn Live in Reykjavík Tonight – Nice Way to Repay “the Generous Gift” of Citizenship,2022/03/11,"Musician Damon Albarn will be performing at the Harpa Music and Conference Hall in Reykjavík tonight. In an interview published on RÚV this morning, Albarn observed that the concert – his first in Iceland in 25 years – was a nice way to pay back “the beautiful compliment” of having been granted Icelandic citizenship. Blur-frontman and Gorillaz founder Damon Albarn will be performing at the Harpa Music and Conference Hall tonight. The concert marks the last stop on the musician’s The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows tour. It’s been over two decades since Albarn last performed in Iceland, or since stepping on stage with Blur in 1996. Speaking to radio host Ólafur Páll Gunnarsson on Rás 2 this morning, Albarn stated: “It’s my first gig in 25 years in Iceland. And on this trajectory, it could take another 25 years. I’ll be in my late seventies then – so you better come and see me now.” The musician subsequently admitted that the concert seemed long overdue, especially considering his new legal status in Iceland. “Considering that I’m an Icelandic national, as well … it’s a chance for me to, sort of, you know, pay back that beautiful compliment and generous gift that I’ve been given.” Albarn was granted citizenship last year. At tonight’s concert, Albarn will be performing the album The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows in its entirety. As noted on Harpa’s website, Albarn has found musical inspiration in Iceland’s nature and landscapes since first coming to the country nearly three decades ago. “This new piece – inspired by Albarn’s long-time love for Iceland – will see the musician perform this very personal piece with an ensemble in what will be his first concert in Iceland in 25 years. The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows was written and composed entirely in Iceland. The title is taken from a John Clare poem entitled Love and Memory.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
922,Iceland Review,"Titanic LEGO Master Builds Icelandair Replica, His ‘Coolest Model Yet’",2022/03/06,"Friends Brynjar Karl Birgisson and Mikael Þór Arnarsson are building a 2m [6 ft] LEGO replica of an Icelandair Boeing MAX 9, a project that they’ve been working on since summer 2021. RÚV reports that the pair is completing the model over the weekend at the Smáralind shopping mall and will place the final brick on Sunday. This is not the first time Brynjar Karl, who has autism, has made headlines for a monumental LEGO project. In 2018, he completed an 8 m [26 ft] LEGO replica of the Titanic, using actual blueprints of the ill-fated ocean liner. It took Brynjar Karl, then 15, over 700 hours and 65,000 LEGOs to build. The replica is the largest LEGO model of the Titanic in the world and currently on display in the Titanic Museum in Pigeon Forge, TN. At the time Brynjar Karl credited the project with helping him “out of my autistic fog,” saying, “I was totally unable to communicate when I started the project. Now I’m standing on stage and giving interviews.” Ever since, he’s used his Titanic-building experience and LEGO construction endeavors as a means of building awareness around autism; he gave a TED Talk in 2016 called “My Autistic X Factor,” and a documentary, “How the Titanic Became My Lifeboat,” was made about his experience. See Also: Icelandic Teen’s Giant Lego Titanic On Display in US While still very proud of his Titanic project, Brynjar Karl is even more excited about the Icelandair model. The pair have put a great deal of effort into making the model as precise and accurate as possible.   “From my perspective, even though I made the Titanic, this here is the coolest [model] I’ve made because of how it looks and also because I’m working with as brilliant a builder as my friend Mikael,” he said.

923,Iceland Review,Icelandic Artist Packs Up Exhibition in Russia,2022/02/28,"Contemporary Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson has put a stop to his exhibition Santa Barbara that was taking place in the newly-opened GEC-2 contemporary art museum in Moscow, Russia, RÚV reports. Kjartan says there was no question that packing up the exhibition was the right thing to do after Russia invaded Ukraine last Thursday. Ragnar is an internationally renowned artist, having exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Tate Modern, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, among other places. “It’s not possible to exhibit this piece when this horror has begun,” Ragnar stated. “The piece is about the beginning of the Russia that came to be after the Soviet Union. And that Russia ended [last Thursday]. Now it’s just become a full-blown fascist state.” Ragnar’s piece Santa Barbara is named after the US soap opera that started being broadcast in Russia one week after the fall of the Soviet Union. The exhibition recreates the series one episode at a time under the direction of Ása Helga Hjörleifsdóttir. A team of crew and actors had recreated one episode from the show each day since the beginning of December, until the decision to stop was made last week. The exhibition was originally supposed to run for an additional two weeks.  Read More: Staging Reality Ragnar says Russian artists have told him of being censored or imprisoned due to their art. “It’s just been an incredible experience to make art in this situation, where it’s almost like being in a thriller,” Ragnar stated. “You meet all kinds of people that have been put in prison, experienced bomb threats, censorship and I don’t know what else.” A New York Times article from December describes Russian artist Maria V. Alyokhina’s criticism of the GEC-2 grand opening as “hosting a feast during a plague,” a reference to a play by Alexander Pushkin. “It’s really cool what they are doing, I really like it. It’s just, we have reality also, not only ‘Santa Barbara,’” Alyokhina said, implying the arts centre was ignoring Russia’s political reality. Ragnar is also quoted in the article as saying: “Many things can be criticized in this country, but we cannot look away from the fact that the Russian culture is completely awesome.”",Culture,0,1,0,0,0,0
924,Iceland Review,New Technology for Prawn Fishing Uses Light to Reduce Emissions,2022/06/22,"An Icelandic company has developed a technology for prawn fishing that uses light to herd prawn up from the sea floor. This allows the fishing equipment to remain off the sea floor, leading to less disturbance of the environment and lower emissions than conventional trawling. The technology is set to be put on the market soon. “We are developing the next generation of fishing equipment. Fishing equipment that can fly close to the bottom without touching the bottom. Then we have a light that herds,” Halla Jónsdóttir, founder of Optitog, told RÚV reporters. Optitog has named this patented light beam technology “Virtual Trawl” and has data that shows that it results in higher yields, compared to using the equipment with the light off. “We have a special light that forms a sort of wall or line in the sea and we see that it works to herd [the prawn].” The prawn swims ahead of the light, up off the sea floor and into the nets. It’s possible to set the equipment so that it travels a consistent distance above the sea floor, for example 30 centimetres [11.8 inches]. Because Optitog’s equipment does not trawl along the sea floor, it encounters 30% less resistance than conventional trawling, meaning the method drastically reduces fuel consumption. By leaving the sea floor largely undisturbed, the new technology also reduces CO2 emissions caused by disturbing organic material on the bottom of the ocean. Halla says that a Norwegian party is working to put Optitog on the market as an environmentally-friendly fishing technology. Halla believes the technology could be applied to fishing other species.","Business,Nature,Sci&Tech",1,0,1,0,0,0
925,Iceland Review,Iceland’s Interest Rates Pass Pre-Pandemic Heights,2022/06/22,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland has decided to raise the bank’s interest rates by 1%. The bank’s key interest rate is now 4.75%, higher than it has been since March 2019, when it stood at 4.5%. The hike continues a trend of rising rates, with the Central Bank citing inflation as a key factor. While the Central Bank reports that GDP growth was somewhat stronger in the first quarter of this year than assumed in their May forecast and domestic economic activity remains strong, it underlines that the global economic outlook is “highly uncertain.” Households’ and businesses’ expectations about economic developments have also grown “more tepid,” according to the MPC. Inflation rose to 7.6% in May, with house prices and other domestic cost items cited as “strong drivers of inflation.” Price hikes are widespread and global oil and commodity prices have also risen sharply, the Central Bank notes. Inflation expectations have risen by most measures and are above target. See Also: Government Approves Measures to Counteract Inflation “The MPC considers it likely that the monetary stance will have to be tightened even further so as to ensure that inflation eases back to target within an acceptable time frame,” the statement from the committee concludes. Iceland’s Central Bank lowered interest rates repeatedly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with the stated aims of bolstering the economy and maintaining stability on the housing market. Rates reached a historic low of 0.75% in November 2020, but the Central Bank began raising rates steadily once more in early 2021.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
926,Iceland Review,"Business Booming for Online Alcohol Retailers, Even Though Online Sales Aren’t Legal",2022/06/19,"Alþingi has yet to vote on whether private Icelandic retailers will be allowed to sell alcohol online, but RÚV reports that business is already booming for sellers willing to risk wading into this lucrative market before online sales are legalized. Starting July 1, craft breweries will be allowed to sell alcohol on their premises. Alþingi voted in favour of this change on Wednesday. The bill to allow private retailers to sell alcohol online, however, was not voted on before the end of parliament’s session. But this hasn’t stopped Elías Blöndal Guðjónsson, co-owner of the online alcohol retailer Santewines SAS, from cashing in this holiday weekend. And not just this weekend, either: Like a small number of fellow sellers willing to take the risk before online sales are legalized, Santewines has been selling alcohol online for over a year and sales are increasing all the time. See Also: Local Distributor Flouts Prohibitions on Home Beer Delivery June 17th is Iceland’s National Day, so while people would normally be queuing in Vínbúð locations around the country to stock up on bevvies for the weekend, such wasn’t possible on Friday, when all state-run liquor store locations were closed. So many of these would-be customers hopped over to Elías’ website instead. Elías said he isn’t worried about his operation being shut down, even though online alcohol sales haven’t been legalized yet. “We have all our ducks in a row and everything’s in order. We have a French company that is handling the online shop and legal products and we’re no more afraid than Amazon or EBay,” he remarked. “I don’t actually think there are many people who have it out for the business,” Elías concluded. “Maybe ÁTVR [the State Alcohol and Tobacco Company, which runs Iceland’s Vínbúð stores], and maybe some Progressive Party MPs.

927,Iceland Review,"Less Cod, More Haddock To Be Fished Next Year",2022/06/16,"The Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Research Institute has suggested a 6% decrease in cod catch quotas for the next fishing season. A notice from the Institute states that the decline is due to a lower estimate of the reference biomass compared to previous years and the effect of the catch stabiliser in the harvest control rule. The Institute is hopeful for cod in Icelandic waters, stating: “The reference biomass of cod is expected to increase slightly in the next two to three years when the 2019 and 2020 cohorts enter the reference biomass as they are estimated to be above average in terms of size.” Meanwhile, suggested catch quotas for haddock increase to 62,219 tonnes, up 23% from last year. MFRI Director Þorsteinn Sigurðsson stated in an introductory meeting that several fish stocks, including tusk, ling, blue ling, beaked redfish, anglerfish, witch, megrim, and langoustine, have been experiencing poor recruitment in the past few years, Fiskifréttir report. These fish stay in the warmer waters to the south and west coast of Iceland. “Unfortunately, there seems to be little change for the better. The reasons for this negative development are unknown, but the most likely explanation is that it’s due to changes in Iceland’s marine environment.”

928,Iceland Review,Craft Unions Call for More Spots in Vocational Schools,2022/06/08,"Around 2,000 craftspeople are needed in the labour market to fulfil promises on housing construction, RÚV reports. Approximately 700 students will be denied a place in Reykjavík’s Technical College, Iceland’s largest vocational training institution. The Federation of Icelandic Industries and the Federation of Skilled Construction & Industrial Workers challenge authorities to take charge of the issue. Most municipality coalition agreements following the recent municipal elections emphasise the importance of increasing construction. 3500-4,000 apartments need to be constructed per year to keep up with the population increase. This year, that number will be less than 3,000. Chief Economist with the Federation of Icelandic Industries Ingólfur Bender told RÚV that around 2,000 skilled craftsmen are needed to meet the building requirements. “At the same time as there’s a shortage of skilled workers, we’re turning people away who want to start their vocational training. Last year around 700 were turned away, and it looks like that number will be even higher this year. This is very bad. The problem is not within the educational system because they have every intention to do better. What’s lacking is that the authorities divert funds to the system,” stated Ingólfur. The Federation of Skilled Construction & Industrial Workers Chair Hilmar Harðarson agrees, stating: “this is a common problem of all craft unions that we need more seats in the training programmes. We need to build a new Technical College and maybe even another school yet in the Capital Area. Of course, we hope that Icelandic Craftsmen will construct all these new apartments. It’s hard to see that happening as the situation is now. It is becoming harder to get craftsmen from Poland and other countries, so we’re seeking staff in locations that we’re less familiar with. We’re producing half the craftspeople compared to other European countries.” Hilmar stated that elementary school students have priority when it comes to places in the schools. When asked if older students were less likely to get a seat in the vocational training programs, he replied: “Yes, most of the 700 people who were turned away from the Technical College last year were older students.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
929,Iceland Review,New Designer Shopping and Dining Centre Hafnartorg Gallery to Open Downtown,2022/06/05,"Downtown is about to get another designer facelift. Vísir reports that 11 new shops and restaurants, all of which will be housed in the newly anointed Hafnartorg Gallery, are expected to open in the next five weeks. The gallery is located between Arnarhóll and the Kolapórtið flea market and its opening signals the long-awaited conclusion to more than decade’s worth of development between the Harpa Concert Hall and Lækjartorg. See Also: Sizeable Hotel Rises Beside Harpa Downtown Reykjavík has been under near-constant construction since ground was first broken on Harpa in 2007. (After the Icelandic economy collapsed in 2008, construction halted on Harpa—and in Iceland in general—until the government decided to step in and fund the building’s completion, making it the only active construction project in Iceland for several years following the crash.) In recent years, this harbourside district has added high-end apartment buildings, a luxury hotel, a pedestrian mall, and a variety of shops. And the end is finally in sight: after Hafnartorg Gallery opens, Landsbankinn’s new building is the area’s last major construction project.

He says that most of the restaurants are on pace to open slightly ahead of the stores, but the goal is for everything to open by early July. The gallery will house the largest 66° North in Iceland, as well as the country’s first North Face location, the lifestyle store Casa, an 80-seat fine dining restaurant focused on contemporary Franco-Italian cooking, and seven smaller restaurants catering to a range of tastes.

930,Iceland Review,Iceland Tightens Regulations on Blood Mare Farms,2022/06/02,"Blood mare farming, the practice of extracting blood from pregnant mares for sale, will soon be subject to a licence in Iceland. This is one of several measures the Icelandic government is taking to tighten and clarify regulations on the controversial practice. The new regulations will be valid for three years, during which authorities will “assess its future,” according to a government notice. Iceland’s blood mare farm industry made international headlines last winter after the Germany-based Animal Welfare Foundation posted a documentary on YouTube under the heading “Iceland – Land of the 5,000 Blood Mares.” The documentary contained footage showcasing ill treatment of horses on blood farms, including horses being shouted at and hit. Read More: Blood Farms Documentary Shocks the Nation Following the publication of the video, the Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir appointed a working group to review the practice and whether it ensured the welfare of the animals involved. The working group’s report, published yesterday, concluded that existing regulations on the practice were “very vague and not acceptable, as they concern a fairly extensive and controversial activity.” In addition to implementing a licencing system for the practice, the group proposed tightening regulations on blood mare farming “with regard to the views of stakeholders and others with whom the working group spoke.” These include more detailed provisions on conditions and facilities at the farms, monitoring of horse health, grooming, and temperament assessment, as well as the working methods of blood collection and internal and external monitoring. The report’s authors proposed banning production systems based on mass production of mares’ blood, as they could endanger the welfare of the animals. The working group consisted of representatives from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries, the Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST), and the University of Iceland’s Centre for Ethics. The Animal Welfare Foundation and many other interest groups were consulted in the writing of the report. Since the 1980s, horse farmers in Iceland have been able to gain extra income by extracting the hormone Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) from their pregnant mares. This hormone exists in pregnant mares’ blood and can be removed and sold for hefty sums. To begin with, blood farming was a secondary practice on horse farms, but later, some farmers turned their focus to the practice, with data from 2019 indicating that 95 farmers supplied pregnant mare’s blood. Just one company, Ísteka, buys and processes blood harvested from mares in Iceland. The hormone extracted from pregnant mares is mainly used to boost fertility in other farm animals. Only a handful of countries operate blood farms besides Iceland: Russia, Mongolia, China, Uruguay, and Argentina.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
931,Iceland Review,"PLAY Reports ISK 1.5 Billion Loss in Q1, Maintains ‘Strong Balance Sheet and Healthy Cash Position’",2022/05/25,"Iceland’s newest discount airline, PLAY, reported a loss of ISK 1.5 billion [$11.5 million; €10.78 million] in the first quarter of 2022. Per the Interim Report (January – March 2022) issued by the company this week, this comes as no real surprise, and can largely be credited to global factors, namely, “[t]he Omicron variant impacted revenue during the quarter, and the war in Ukraine resulted in higher fuel price towards the end of the quarter.” The negative EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) was “expected,” writes CEO Birgir Jónsson, who remains optimistic about the airline’s prospects. Travellers are showing an increasing willingness to fly, and the airline’s “financial position…continues to be strong, with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash position.” PLAY’s equity ratio stands at 22% ($56.5 million; €52.7 million; ISK 7.3 billion) and it is maintaining a cash position of ISK 5.4 billion [$43 million; €39.2]. Currency risk is a factor in the airline’s operations, “…since a large part of its cash position is in the ISK, while PLAY’s operating currency is in USD. PLAY is therefore exposed to the fluctuation of the two currencies against each other.” Rapid network expansion  Between January and March 2022, PLAY carried 57,500 passengers, with a 20% jump in passenger numbers from February to March. The airline hired 45 pilots and over 100 new cabin crew members in Q1. PLAY is steadily expanding its network and plans to continue to do so in Q2. Service to Baltimore/Washington, D.C. began in April; service to Prague, Boston, Lisbon, Gothenburg, and Brussels began in May, with destinations Stavanger, Malaga, and Trondheim on the horizon before the end of the month. In early June, service to Palma de Mallorca and Bologna will commence, as will daily flights to New York in the US. Indeed, PLAY will be the first airline to operate international flights from New York Stewart International Airport (located about 75 mi; 120 km outside of New York City) post-pandemic. ‘Strong booking momentum’ As part of its strategy to counter rising fuel prices that have resulted from the war in Ukraine, however, PLAY is adjusting its summer fleet plan and will not be offering three weekly flights to and from Orlando, Florida this fall as planned. Additional measures to counter rising fuel prices include a fuel hedging strategy, a fuel surcharge, and ongoing schedule adjustments “to eliminate unprofitable flying.” Passenger hesitation in the wake of the Omicron variant and global unrest appears to be waning, and bookings are on the upswing. “In February, [there were] 59% more sold seats compared to January, despite the war in Ukraine. This improvement in booking inflow has continued into the second quarter of 2022, with more than fourfold increase in sold seats in April compared to January. Because of this strong booking momentum,” concludes the report, “PLAY expects to report improved utilization in the coming months.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

933,Iceland Review,Central Bank Raises Interest Rates by 1%,2022/05/04,"The Central Bank of Iceland’s key interest rate will be raised to 3.75%, rising ever-closer to pre-pandemic figures. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced a 1% interest rate hike this morning. The MPC says the economic outlook has deteriorated due to the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In March 2019, the Central Bank’s key interest rate stood at 4.5%. It was lowered repeatedly throughout the pandemic in efforts to bolster the economy and maintain stability on the housing market. Interest rates reached a historic low of 0.75% in November 2020, but the Central Bank has been steadily raising rates once more over the past year. Despite the worse outlook as compared to February’s forecast, the MPC says there are “signs of strong domestic economic activity” in Iceland, including a tightening labour market. GDP growth is forecast at 4.6% for the year 2022, and a growth rate of just under 3% in 2023 and 2024. Combating inflation continues to be a challenge, according to the MPC, which cites “house prices and other domestic cost items” as strong drivers of inflation, as well as global oil and commodity prices. Underlying inflation currently measures 5%, with inflation in the month of April measuring 7.2%. The Central Bank predicts that inflation will rise above 8% in the third quarter of this year. The MPC expects interest rate hikes and “tighter borrower-based measures” to slow down house price inflation and domestic demand. The Committee states, however, that it is likely the monetary stance will have to be tightened even further in coming months to ease inflation. “Decisions taken at the corporate level, the labour market, and in public sector finances will be a major determinant of how high interest rates must rise,” the notice concludes.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
934,Iceland Review,"Inflation Rate Continues to Climb, Peak Expected in June",2022/04/29,"The annual inflation rate hit 7.2% yesterday, a 12-year high. Analysts at Íslandsbanki bank predict that the inflation rate will peak in June at 7.7%. Statistics Iceland updated its consumer price index (a proxy for inflation) yesterday. The latest figures indicate that the annual inflation rate has hit a 12-year high, or 7.2%, with the CPI having risen every month since last August. As noted by RÚV, the consumer price index increased by 1.25% last month: the largest one-month increase since February of 2013. The biggest driver for this increase is a 2.4% rise in the price of housing and utilities, the single most significant category in the calculation of the CPI (29.3% of total weight), accounting for a rise of 0.45%. “Housing and utilities are by far the most important driver of inflation in Iceland, first and foremost rent (cost of housing),” Erna Björg Sverrisdóttir, Chief Economist at Arion Bank, stated in an interview with Mbl.is yesterday. “Of course, the war in Ukraine is beginning to affect inflation,” she continued. “We’ve seen gas prices rise and the price of imported goods, as well. This trend, the gradual increase in inflation among our main trading partners, had begun before the war, but the war has exacerbated these effects,” (As noted by Kjarninn, the CPI would be approximately 3% lower if housing and utilities had remained unchanged over the past 12 months.) Another increase that affected the CPI was a rise in the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages, which increased by 1.4% between months. (Food and non-alcoholic beverages account for 14.7% of the CPI’s total weight). The rise in the cost of dairy products also contributed to inflation, raising the consumer price index by 0.2%. Airfares likewise increased by 22.9%, causing a 0.37% rise in the index. The current inflation rate exceeds predictions made by the Central Bank: In early February, the Central Bank forecast an annual inflation rate of 5.8% during the first quarter of 2022 and 5.6% during the second quarter. The forecast was, however, published before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in various increases within the international market. Only 15 days have passed since Landsbanki bank predicted that the inflation rate would peak in June at 7%. Íslandsbanki bank predicts that the inflation rate will peak in June at 7.7%. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson stated that Iceland’s economic outlook was “improving,” despite rising inflation.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
935,Iceland Review,Government to Dismantle State Investment Company,2022/04/19,"The Icelandic government will introduce a parliamentary bill to abolish Icelandic State Financial Investments, the government’s holding company on the financial market. The decision is made in response to widespread criticism of how the government handled the sale of 22.5% of Íslandsbanki bank last month. No further sale of the state’s shares in Íslandsbanki will take place until a new system is in place, a notice from the government states. The sale of 22.5% of formerly state-owned bank Íslandsbanki last month through a private stock offering has been harshly criticised by opposition MPs as well as the general public. Several hundred gathered in Austurvöllur square last Friday to protest the way the sale was handled. One of the speakers at the event, Pirate Party MP Halldóra Mogensen, called on Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson to resign. The government has been criticised for the share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value, despite high demand for the shares. Many have also criticised the fact that smaller, short-term investors were permitted to take part in the sale, and that Íslandsbanki staff and staff of the consulting company that managed the sale were among the investors. While the government’s stated aim for the share offering was to attract long-term investors, shareholder lists revealed that many smaller investors sold their shares in the bank just days after the sale, for a significant profit. The list of purchasers included a holding company owned by the Finance Minister’s father. Government ministers have refused interview requests from reporters over the past week to discuss the sale of the bank. The government notice released today states that “It is clear that the implementation of the sale did not fully live up to the government’s expectations, e.g. on transparency and clear dissemination of information.”  ","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
936,Iceland Review,Many Íslandsbanki Buyers Have Already Sold for Profit,2022/04/13,"Of the 207 investors who purchased shares in Íslandsbanki bank in a private share offering last month, 132 have already sold some or all of their stake in the formerly state-owned bank, Kjarninn reports. The sellers have made a cumulative profit of ISK 1.6-2.1 billion [$12.3-16.2 million; €11.4-15 million]. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson had previously stated that the aim of the share offering was to acquire long-term investors in the bank. Íslandsbanki was fully owned by the government until last year, when it sold a 35% stake in the bank, something that had been on the government agenda for years. While that first offering was open to the public, last month’s offering was solely open to professional investors. The second sale was successful, reducing the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. The government has been criticised for the latter share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value. Notably, six foreign investment funds that were invited to take part in the offering sold all of their purchased shares in the bank within three days of listing, at a significant profit. These funds also participated in last year’s public share offering, meaning they have turned quick profits on the sale of the bank’s shares for a second time. Those funds include Silver Point Capital, Fiera Capital, Lansdowne Partners, and Key Square Partners. According to the shareholder lists Kjarninn has in its possession, most of the “smaller” investors that took part in last month’s share offering have already sold their shares in the Íslandsbanki. In total, 59 investors were permitted to buy shares for under ISK 30 million and another 79 for under ISK 50 million. Among the purchasers who are no longer listed as shareholders of Íslandsbanki are employees and owners of the consulting company that was hired to manage the stock offering. Some larger investors who took part in the offering, who bought shares worth several hundred million ISK, have also sold their stake in the bank. This includes Steinn Holding Company, owned by Samherji seafood company CEO Þorsteinn Már Baldvinsson and his ex-wife. One particularly controversial buyer in the offering was the company Hafsilfur, owned by Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson. The Finance Minister is responsible for the sale of Íslandsbanki, according to law. Hafsilfur is still listed as a shareholder in Íslandsbanki, and its shares have increased in value by around ISK 5 million since the share offering. Pension funds and other institutional investors have bought up a large part of the shares that smaller investors have sold at profit since the share offering. It was previously reported that pension funds requested to were allotted fewer shares in the offering than they had requested. The Central Bank of Iceland has stated it is investigating the sale.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
937,Iceland Review,Unprecedented Mass Layoff at Efling Union,2022/04/13,"Efling Union’s decision to lay off all of its staff has stirred up conflict within the labour movement in Iceland. The union’s returning chairperson Sólveig Anna Jónsdóttir says the layoffs were inevitable, but she has received harsh criticism for the decision from the Icelandic Confederation of Labour and the Icelandic Confederation of University Graduates. All employees of the Efling Union office received a letter of dismissal by email at 2:00 AM this morning. The letter states that their employment contract has been terminated due to “organisational and operational changes” that apply to all full-time positions at the union. It also states that the period of notice is in accordance with each individual’s employment contract, but employees are requested to fulfill their work obligations during the notice period. Sólveig Anna has stated that the dismissals were an inevitable part of the changes that she is implementing as returning chairperson of the union. The dismissals are intended to support an acceptable gap between the lowest and highest wages at the union office and ensure equality and transparency in employee wages, according to Sóveig Anna. The dismissal letter says new positions at the union will be advertised and encourages laid-off employees to apply. Both Drífa Snædal, the president of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour (ASÍ) and Friðrik Jónsson, the chairman of the Icelandic Confederation of University Graduates (BHM) have criticised the group dismissal. Friðrik called the layoff alarming and stated it was clear that the board of Efling wanted to get rid of unwanted employees. Sólveig Anna resigned as chair of Efling last October, in the wake of allegations of bullying within the Efling office. During Sólveig Anna’s four-year tenure, the union spent close to ISK 130 million [$1.04 million; € 909,063] on personnel-related matters and 40 out of 50 of the union’s employees (80%) resigned from their positions, according to a report prepared in collaboration with the union. Sólveig was re-elected as chair of the union in February. Assistant Professor of History Sumarliði Ísleifsson, who has researched the history of Iceland’s labour movement, called this morning’s layoffs unprecedented and stated that they could impact the upcoming wage negotiations. According to Sumarliði, the Icelandic labour movement’s strength in recent negotiations has been based in solidarity between unions and confederations.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
938,Iceland Review,Legal Obstacles to Revealing Íslandsbanki Buyers,2022/04/06,"Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI) has stated it is not able to publish the data on who purchased shares in Íslandsbanki during last month’s stock offering. The government has been criticised for the share offering’s lack of transparency, and for the 5% discount buyers received on the shares’ market value. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has previously stated that if the ISFI is not able to publish information then the Icelandic Parliament should amend legislation to make it possible. Íslandsbanki was fully owned by the government until last year, when it sold a 35% stake in the bank, something that had been on the government agenda for years. While that first offering was open to the public, last month’s offering was solely open to professional investors. The second sale was successful, reducing the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson stated yesterday that the information on who the buyers were would be published, if permitted by law. In an interview this morning, Chairman of ISFI’s board Lárus Blöndal stated that ISFI does not consider itself able to publish the data, as it is likely the buyers’ identity falls under bank secrecy regulations. He added that it is virtually unheard of for buyers to be publicly identified when such offerings are conducted abroad. A total of 209 parties bought shares in the March offering. The Finance Minister has previously stated that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers. Lárus stated that all of the buyers could be legally classified as professional investors. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has argued that when state property is sold, the Icelandic public is entitled to know who the buyers are. During Alþingi’s question period on Monday, she stated that “If any technical factors cause ISFI to consider ifself unable to publish that information, I believe it is right for Alþingi to make appropriate changes to the legal framework so that it can be published, anything else is unacceptable.” Read more about the sale of state-owned banks in Iceland.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
939,Iceland Review,Skál! New Bill Would Allow Breweries to Sell Beer On-Site,2022/03/26,"A new bill would make it legal for small-scale breweries to sell alcohol on site. Vísir reports that the bill, presented by Minister of Justice Jón Gunnarsson, would allow breweries to sell bottled or can beer to visitors without having to resort to complicated and expensive workarounds, like applying for a liquor license and opening an on-site bar. A similar bill was presented by former Minister of Justice Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir, but was met with protest from the state liquor authority (ÁTVR), which argued that the proposed changes would undermine state-run liquor stores. See Also: Local Distributor Flouts Prohibitions on Home Beer Delivery ÁTVR recently faced a setback in a similar attempt to quash alcohol retail on the open market. Just last week, the Reykjavík District Court ruled against the authority in its case against Sante ehf., Santewine SAS, and Bjórland, retail outlets that have begun selling alcohol outside of the state monopoly. In its case, ÁTVR demanded that these companies cease operations because ÁTVR holds the exclusive right to sell alcohol in Iceland. ÁTVR has decided to appeal the recent ruling, but Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson, whose ministry oversees ÁTVR, would like to see the current bill go even further, saying he’d like to see traditional online alcohol retail permitted in Iceland.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
940,Iceland Review,State Sells 22.5% Stake in Íslandsbanki,2022/03/24,"The Icelandic government sold a 22.5% stake in Íslandsbanki bank last Tuesday in an offering for professional investors. Opposition MPs have criticised the shares’ low price and the sale’s lack of transparency. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson says the aim was to acquire long-term investors and that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers. Íslandsbanki was fully owned by the Icelandic state until last year, when it sold a 35% stake in the bank, something that had been on the government agenda for years. While last year’s sale was a public offering, this week’s was only open to professional investors, who received an invitation to buy shares, which were then sold at a 5% discount from their market value. The sale was successful, reducing the government’s stake in the bank from 65% to 42.5%. According to information from Icelandic State Financial Investments (ISFI), demand for the shares was high. Both Icelandic and foreign investors showed interest in the sale, though the identity of the investors has not been made public. Investors were required to sign a confidentiality agreement, meaning they were temporarily granted access to inside information. Investors had already made a profit yesterday, when shares in the bank rose by ISK 4-5 billion [$31.1-38.9 million; €28.3-35.4 million] following the sale. MPs criticised the sale’s lack of transparency in Parliament yesterday, as well as the discount given to investors. Financial expert Ásgeir Brynjar Torfason told RÚV it is unclear how the investors were selected, and that is a question that ISFI and the Ministry of Finance need to answer. He also called on authorities to answer why such a large discount was given, despite high demand for the shares. In an interview with RÚV, Minister of Finance Bjarni Benediktsson called the discount on the shares a small one, saying that Icelandic pension funds were the main purchasers in the offering. “We did not go the route of looking for the pension fund or the investor who wanted to offer the highest price and let them have as much as they wanted. We took another route. We wanted to go toward more decentralised ownership and we wanted to consider what the market conditions would be like when the offering ended.

941,Iceland Review,Icelandic Company Plans to Recommence Whaling This Summer,2022/03/24,"Whaling company Hvalur hf. plans to recommence hunting whales this summer, after three years of no activity, Vísir reports. The company’s CEO Kristján Loftsson says fin whales will be the target and that market conditions for whale products are good. No whaling has taken place in Iceland since 2018, and the Minister of Fisheries has indicated the practice will be permanently stopped after 2023. Hvalur hf. plans to begin hunting in June and continue into September, according to Kristján. Some 150 employees are expected to staff the company’s whaling ships, whaling station in Hvalfjörður, West Iceland, and their processing plant in Hafnarfjörður. Kristján stated that the main reason for the company’s lack of activity in recent years is conflict with the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority concerning the company’s whaling station. He has previously cited poor market conditions and COVID-19 for the decision. Whaling licences in Iceland are issued for periods of a few years at a time. In a column published in Morgunblaðið last month, Iceland’s Minister of Fisheries Svandís Svavarsdóttir stated that there was little justification to permit whaling in Iceland after the current licence expires in 2023. There is little evidence that whaling is economically beneficial to Iceland, the Minister stated, adding that the controversial nature of the practice has a negative impact on Iceland, though it may be hard to measure. Hvalur hf. is Iceland’s main whaling company, and has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years. Public outcries followed when the company killed a pregnant fin whale and a rare hybrid whale in 2018. Hvalur hf. was at risk of losing their whaling licence after failing to submit captains’ logs for the 2014, 2015, and 2018 seasons.

942,Iceland Review,Electric Car Share Launches in Reykjavík,2022/03/21,"There’s a new way to get around Reykjavík for residents and visitors: shared electric cars. Transportation app Hopp, which introduced shared electric scooters to the city in 2019, has now added ten electric cars to its fleet of vehicles. Users can rent a car through the app, drive it from A to B, and park and leave it anywhere within the active zone. “People are calling for a variety of forms of transportation and the environment is calling for us to change our travel habits,” a Facebook post from the company reads. “We believe that the time is now; city residents are calling for diversity in transport, and by offering shared cars, we are bridging a certain gap. People can take public transport to work and then take a shared car if they need to run an errand during working hours. Families can therefore do away with the “extra car” and use a shared car when needed.” The shared cars are also useful for those who do not own a private car but need to run errands that are more difficult to do on public transport or a bike, such as making a trip to big box stores in the suburbs, the company points out. The Hopp cars cost a flat fee of ISK 300 [$2.33; €2.11] to rent, and ISK 45 [$0.35; €0.32] per minute to drive, meaning a trip between the University of Iceland and the Grandi harbour area would cost around ISK 660 [$5.12; €4.63]. It costs ISK 10 [$0.08; €0.07] per minute to “pause” a rental, for example, to run an errand while the car is parked. Reykjavík Mayor Dagur B.

943,Iceland Review,Home Slaughter More Humane and Profitable,2022/03/17,"Home slaughter can be more humane for lambs and more profitable for farmers than sending livestock to slaughterhouses, says Þröstur Heiðar Erlingsson, one of Iceland’s first farmers to implement the practice since it was legalised last spring. According to Þröstur, there is growing interest among both consumers and shops for buying directly from farmers. Þröstur and his wife Ragnheiður Erla Brynjólfsdóttir will provide free instruction on home slaughter to other sheep farmers across the country. Home slaughter of lambs and goats was legalised in Iceland last spring, as part of a 12-point action plan to support farmers in meeting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, sheep and goat farmers in Iceland were required to send livestock to licenced slaughterhouses. A pilot project and virtual inspections in 2020 and 2021 were part of ensuring that home slaughter would conform to health and safety standards. Farmers who slaughter at home receive all the offal, the head of the lamb, and the sheepskin, by-products that are most often discarded when livestock are sent to a slaughterhouse, Þröstur says. Farmers can then package and sell products directly to consumers or shops. Þröstur points out that when lambs are slaughtered at the farm, they also do not have to be transported long distances and put in unfamiliar surroundings, which makes the process more humane. Þröstur and Ragnheiður received a grant to share their experience with other farmers, and will soon provide free instruction on home slaughter in the form of virtual meetings. “We got into this to help farmers, so they don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Now we’ve gained experience, slaughtered at home, and gone through it. We just want to share that knowledge and information with other farmers,” Þröstur stated.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

Gasoline prices rose to ISK 303 ($2.27; €2.06) per litre around the country this morning, while diesel prices also surpassed ISK 300 per litre. Nasdaq Iceland’s index has dropped 12% since the invasion began, with the value of Icelandair stocks dropping by 32%. This drop has entirely erased the stock exchange’s steady gains over the past year. Nasdaq Iceland’s selected share index hit a low in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It rose gradually from that date, until reaching a high point last September, RÚV reports. The day the Russian invasion began, the selected share index dropped by 6%. The stock index remains significantly higher than it was in March 2020, but its gains over the past year have been fully erased. Íslandsbánki’s Chief Economist Jón Bjarki Bentsson outlined the three main factors causing stock prices to fall in Iceland. Firstly, the uncertainty created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has pushed investors to opt for less volatile assets. Secondly, rising energy and raw material prices impact the operations of companies that depend on those resources. Thirdly, the uncertain economic outlook on a global level may impact how well Iceland’s tourism industry bounces back from the pandemic and how many people travel to Iceland in the near future. This last factor impacts companies such as Icelandair significantly. Rúnólfur Ólafsson, CEO of the Icelandic Automobile Association, has pointed out that rising gas prices impact often impact those who are the most disadvantaged, as well as impacting the cost of transporting goods and the cost of snow removal for municipalities.

945,Iceland Review,Never Fewer Accidents at Sea,2022/03/08,"While it can seem that bad news is coming from all directions these days, good news is to be found at sea. 2021 saw the fewest accidents at sea reported to the Social Insurance Administration and Icelandic Health Insurance since an incident registry for the fishing industry was established in 1966, MBL.is reports. There were 108 incidents at sea reported in 2021, down from 153 in 2020 and 227 in 2019. Records from the Icelandic Transport Authority show there were 286 reported incidents the year the registry began. 2021 was the fifth year in a row that no Icelander died at sea. The single worst year for the safety of Icelandic seafarers was 1989, when a total of 631 incidents at sea were registered. Overall, the number of cases began to decrease a few years after the Fishermen’s Accident Prevention School was established in 1985. Heiðrún Lind Marteinsdóttir, CEO of the Association of Companies in the Fisheries Sector, told MBL she chalks the decrease in accidents up to the vigilance of fishermen and increased awareness of the importance of safety at sea. She said fisheries companies have taken security issues seriously, pointing out that investments in new vessels have resulted in better working and living conditions at sea. “There are many factors contributing to this success, but first and foremost, I think it is the crew themselves who deserve the biggest share of the credit here,” Heiðrún Lind said. Chairman of the Icelandic Seamen’s Association Valmundur Valmundsson said he is pleased with the latest numbers but added, “We can always do better, preferably, so there are no accidents at sea.” “Seafarers should be able to walk home safely from work. That is the goal of all of us who work on these issues,” he said.

The technology industry could be equally impacted by the conflict. Iceland’s Finance Minister stated he has no qualms regarding the country’s participation in economic sanctions against Russia and that Iceland must accept their potential impact. Alþingi’s Industrial Affairs Committee held a meeting yesterday to discuss the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. Its chairman Stefán Vagn Stefánsson stated that it could be far-reaching, affecting both businesses and consumers in Iceland. The losses in the seafood industry are expected to amount to billions of Icelandic krónur, or tens of millions of US dollars. Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson stated that while the overall impact of the war on Iceland’s economy would be limited, it would affect some of Iceland’s seafood and technology companies considerably. “We must accept some impact, we have to be ready to sacrifice something in order to send a message and it remains to be seen what that [sacrifice] will be,” Bjarni stated, adding that he supported the international efforts to impose economic sanctions on Russia. “I have absolutely no doubts, and I am very happy that a very broad, far-reaching agreement has been achieved to do much more than we have done before, because it has often been criticised that some of what was done [in response to] the annexation of Crimea was too ineffectual.” In 2014, Russia set a ban on food imports from Iceland, along with several other countries, in response to sanctions following the annexation of Crimea.  Seafood exports made up around 90% of exports to Russia at the time. The value of Icelandic trade to Russia dropped from ISK 26 billion [$209m; €187m] in 2014 to ISK 4 billion [$32m; €29m] in 2018. In response to the ban, many Icelandic seafood companies increased exports to Ukraine, which have now been halted due to the war. Iceland’s last government worked to increase trade with Russia, even establishing a Russian-Icelandic chamber of commerce in 2019. The focus was on technology exports, particularly in the food industry. In 2020, exports to Russia amounted to ISK 6.6 billion [$51.2m; €46.2m]. Those exports have also come to a stop now, as Russian companies buying Icelandic products are unable to pay for them in foreign currency since the ruble’s dramatic devaluation.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

The three men were all executives in companies owned by Icelandic seafood company Samherji in Namibia. They are all asking to be permitted to testify in the case from abroad, but the prosecutor intents to file charges against the men, for which they must appear before a judge in Namibia. Samherji was the centre of a media investigation made public in 2019, which alleged that the fishing company had bribed Namibian officials to obtain lucrative quotas, while also taking advantage of international loopholes to avoid taxes. Aðalsteinn and Egill Helgi were Samherji’s managing directors in Namibia. The charges against Egill Helgi are in connection with his work for Esja Holding and Mermaria Seafood Namibia.

950,Iceland Review,Record Sales of Icelandic Yarn in 2021,2022/02/17,"Sales of knitting yarn grew by 50% last year at Ístex, the company that processes about 99% of all Icelandic wool. Ístex is considering introducing night shifts at their factory to increase production. The company’s CEO hopes to invest more in the company in order to reach bigger markets in Asia, the United States, and Russia. The year 2021 was a record year for Ístex both in revenue and profit, Viðskiptablaðið reports. The company’s revenue grew by 44% between years, to ISK 1.2 billion [$9.7 million, €8.5 million] last year. The company made a profit of ISK 93.4 million [$751,000, €661,000] last year, especially impressive compared to the year 2020, when Ístex reported losses of ISK 67.5 million [$543,000, €477,000]. In 2021, the company saw a 50% rise in sales of lopi knitting yarn. Read More: Icelandic Wool Export Up 70% in Pandemic Ístex CEO Sigurður Sævar Gunnarsson says last year’s sales of knitting yarn are likely a historical record for Iceland. More people have taken up their knitting needles in the pandemic, which has led to increased sales both in Iceland and abroad. “We expect continued demand despite the fact that the effects of the COVID pandemic are decreasing. In this light we can mention that after the banking collapse of 2008 there was a big increase in hand knitting, especially in Iceland, that really never decreased.” Ístex has introduced evening shifts to its factory, but is still not managing to meet demand. The company is now considering introducing night shifts as well. Sigurður would like to see increased investment in the company so that it can pursue larger markets. “There are certain opportunities fr us now and we have to fish for them. There are certain markets where we haven’t been able to gain ground.” He particularly mentions the United States and Asia, though Russia is another market that is likely to grow quickly.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
951,Iceland Review,Can’t Trademark ‘Northern Lights’ District Court Rules,2022/02/13,"A hotel operator in Grindavík can’t claim sole use of the phrase ‘Northern Lights’ and prevent other hotels and tourism service providers from using it in their own branding, RÚV reports. The District Court of Reykjavík ruled on the matter on Friday, saying that ‘Northern Light’ is too common a phenomenon for a company to be allowed to trademark the English term. Allowing one Icelandic company the exclusive right to ‘Northern Lights’ (or even ‘Northern Light’ in the singular) would be a disproportionate restriction to impose on other guest accommodation providers. Too Broad a Term to Trademark The owners of Northern Light Inn in Grindavík, South Iceland requested that a ban be imposed on Grótta Northern Lights Apartments and Rooms in Seltjarnarnes, just outside of Reykjavík, preventing the latter business from using the English phrase ‘Northern Lights’ in their name.  The Grindavík hoteliers registered the phrase ‘Northern Light’ as a trademark in 2006 and believed that the Seltjarnarnes hotel’s use of it in their name, even in the plural, was an infringement on their exclusive right to the term. The matter was taken to the county magistrate, who imposed a ban on other businesses using the name. (At time of writing, the hotel was using the English name ‘Grótta Aurora Lights,’ presumably due to the standing ban.) The magistrate’s decision has now been reversed by the District Court in Reykjavík. Reserving exclusive use of the term ‘Northern Light’ for one hotel in Iceland would mean that the trademark holders would be able to prevent businesses across the tourism sector to refer to the northern lights in their English-language marketing or publicity materials, regardless of what services they were offering, said the judge. ‘Northern Light(s)’ is a term that is “closely related to services that it’s well-known that tourists seek out in Icelandic tourism.” The fact that the trademark was for the phrase ‘Northern Light’ in the singular changes nothing, the judge continued, and nor had the plaintiffs in Grindavík proven that tourists had confused the hotel in Seltjarnarnes with the one in Grindavík because they both use ‘Northern Lights’ in their name. See Also: Who Owns HÚ(H)!? This isn’t the first time that there’s been a scuffle over the attempted tradmarking of a commonly used term or phrase in Iceland. In one notable example in 2018, Icelandic cartoonist Hugleikur Dagsson was not allowed to sell t-shirts he designed in honor of the Iceland’s World Cup-qualifying football team because the caption on the shirt was a trademark violation. Hugleikur’s ‘Man Celebrating,’ shirt showed a man in Iceland’s team uniform doing the now-famous ‘Viking Clap’ and shouting “HÚ!” However, Gunnar Þór Andrésson, a sports trainer at the Landspítali Hospital, claimed that the caption was too close to the exclamation “HÚH!” which he’d trademarked.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
952,Iceland Review,Calls on the Banks to “Lighten the Load” of Households,2022/02/11,"The Minister of Culture and Commerce has called on the banks to “lighten the load” of households faced with rising interest rates. The net profit of Iceland’s three largest commercial banks amounted to approximately 80 billion ISK ($643 million / €564 million) last year, Vísir reports. In an interview published in Morgunblaðið yesterday, Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, Minister of Culture and Commerce, called on Iceland’s three largest commercial banks to “lighten the load” of families faced with rising interest rates. The Central Bank raised key interest rates by 0.75% on Wednesday, which may strain the finances of households who have signed non-indexed mortgages. The inflation rate in January was 5.7% – the highest since April of 2012 – and the Central Bank predicts an inflation rate of +5% in 2022 (+5.8% in the first quarter), which is double the Bank’s target. According to Lilja, the three commercial banks have recently reaped “super profits” – a total of ISK 80 billion ($643 million / €564 million) last year – which puts them in a prime position to assist young people and low-income families. Íslandsbanki announced 2021 profits amounting to ISK 23.7 billion ($190 million / €116 million) this week. Landsbanki, 95% owned by the government, had previously declared profits of ISK 28.9 billion ($232 million / €204 million) for 2021, and Arion Bank announced a profit of ISK 28.6 billion ($230 million / €202 million) for 2021. Speaking to Morgunblaðið, Lilja invoked the banks’ “civic duty.” “I think it’s imperative that certain households, especially that of young people and low-income families, are not left holding the bag. It would be better for the banks to intervene immediately and tend to these households. If the banks don’t find a solution, I believe that we should reinstate a levy on banks.” Lilja followed up her comments by referring to a levy imposed by former British PM Margaret Thatcher, which sought to harvest around £400m from the banks, for they were seen to be “escaping the pain of that recession”: “In 1981, Thatcher instated windfall taxes to deal with precisely such conditions, to level the playing field among the citizenry,” Lilja remarked. In an article published on Innherji this morning, Guðrún Hafsteinsdóttir, Chair of the Economic and Finance Committee, stated that forcing the banks to spend a portion of their profits to subsidize interest payments would serve to devalue Íslandsbanki shares (the government has yet to sell 65% of its share in the bank). Asked to respond to Lilja’s comments, Guðrún remarked that they had taken her by surprise. “If the government intends to alter the banks’ operational conditions, such a thing must, one way or another, influence the price of the remaining shares in Íslandsbanki. It’s obvious that if the government, as a shareholder, intervenes in such an encumbering manner, the selling price will be affected.” As noted by Innherji, the government expects to sell its remaining 65% of shares this year and the next. The treasury received ISK 55 billion ($442 million / €388 million) when it sold its 35% share in a stock offering of Íslandsbanki last year. Since then, stocks have risen considerably. Innherji estimates that, according to the current market valuation, the government stands to receive up to ISK 160 billion ($1.3 billion / €1.1 billion) for its remaining shares.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
953,Iceland Review,“An Invisible Group of Foreigners Who Clean Up After Us”,2022/02/10,"
 Cleaning staff in Iceland face too much strain and their working conditions are unacceptable, according to Director of the Federation of General and Special Workers in Iceland (Starfsgreinasamband, or SGS) Flosi Eiríksson. Cleaning is increasingly outsourced by businesses, which puts cleaning workers at risk of isolation, Flosi says. SGS is preparing for collective agreement negotiations later this year, and plans to emphasise improving working conditions for cleaners. Flosi says that the last collective agreement included a review of the working speed and environment of cleaners, but that the review was never carried out. SGS contacted the Administration of Occupational Safety and Health (Vinnueftirlitið), who discovered that cleaners face excessive strain at work. “They were expected to work much too fast, that led to musculoskeletal problems, sick leave, and so on and so forth.” While in the past, cleaners were employed by the businesses and institutions where they worked, now they tend to be employed by large cleaning companies that are hired by businesses. Before this shift occurred, many people worked part-time as cleaners, after work or school. Now many are working as cleaners full time. The Administration of Occupational Safety and Health confirmed that cleaners’ working conditions are equivalent to walking 10 kilometres per hour, each hour they work, which Flosi called “unacceptable.” With cleaning services increasingly outsourced, there is a greater risk that cleaners will be isolated at their workplace. “You are specially marked, you don’t have coffee with other employees, you probably don’t get the staff Christmas present, you don’t go to the staff party, and so on,” Flosi stated. “Sometimes we don’t see those people. Here in the capital area, they’re probably 80-90% people of foreign origin. Maybe we’re, in some sense, creating a tiny invisible group of foreigners who clean up after us.” Flosi also pointed out that by outsourcing cleaning services, government institutions are no longer taking part in collective agreement negotiations for cleaning employees.","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
954,Iceland Review,Opposition Abstains from Voting on “Míla Bill”,2022/02/10,"Iceland’s Parliament passed the so-called “Mila bill” today with 33 votes in favour, RÚV reports. Fifteen MPs abstained from voting, all members of the opposition. The bill is intended to ensure national security in light of the sale of Iceland’s telecommunications company Míla to French fund management company Ardian. Míla, which owns and operates nationwide telecommunications systems, was sold to Ardian last year. All of Iceland’s homes, businesses, and institutions are serviced by Míla’s systems, and many expressed concern that such important infrastructure was being sold to a foreign company. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir has called telecommunications infrastructure “a key issue for public security in every society.” Read More: Parliament Rushing to Ensure National Security Ardian’s purchase of Míla was discussed in the National Security Council and new legislation was drafted, with the stated goal of strengthening and securing the legal basis for electronic communication with regard to national security. Helga Vala Helgadóttir, MP for the Social-Democratic Alliance, has argued that there were many red flags in the government’s handling of the case and that the legislation did not ensure consumer security. The newly-passed bill, introduced last term by then-Minister of Justice Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir, amends the Electronic Communications Act, legislation governing the Electronic Communications Office of Iceland (ECOI), and legislation on foreign investment in business operations.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
955,Iceland Review,Icelandair Ends Government-Guaranteed Credit Facility,2022/02/09,"Icelandair has terminated its government-guaranteed credit facility, which has been in effect since September 2020. The airline stated Monday that it had “successfully navigated the turbulent two years since the onset of the pandemic” and that its financial position was strong. On September 15, 2020 – in the wake of pandemic-induced losses – Icelandair entered into an agreement with Íslandsbanki, Landsbanki, and the Icelandic government for a credit facility of up to $120 million, with a 90% government guarantee. The agreement stipulated a two-year drawdown period, in effect until September 15, 2022. (A credit facility is a type of loan made in a business or corporate-finance context. It allows the borrowing company to take out money over an extended period instead of reapplying for a loan each time.) The credit facility, Icelandair held, was “vital to complete the financial restructuring, enabling the company to maintain valuable know-how, and preserve the infrastructure necessary for an efficient ramp-up of its operations post-Covid.” On Monday, February 7 – seven months before the end of the drawdown period – Icelandair formally terminated its government-guaranteed credit facility. The termination is effective 15 days from Monday. In a statement released Monday, Icelandair Group asserted that the airline had “successfully navigated the turbulent two years since the onset of the pandemic resulting in a strong financial position at year-end 2021.” The airline hopes this solid financial position will support its 2022 flight schedule – with three new leisure destinations in Europe and resumed service to Montreal – and its continued recovery.","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
956,Iceland Review,Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate by 0.75%,2022/02/09,"The Central Bank of Iceland has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. The hike takes the Bank’s key interest rate to 2.75%. In the shadow of rising inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Iceland has decided to raise the Bank’s interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. The Bank’s key interest rate – the rate on seven-day term deposits – will, therefore, be 2.75%. The inflation rate in January was 5.7% – the highest since April of 2012 – and the Central Bank predicts an inflation rate of +5% in 2022 (+5.8% in the first quarter), which is double the Bank’s target. As noted in an announcement this morning, the MPC will not only raise key interest rates but also employ all of its available instruments to ensure that inflation rates subside to target levels within an acceptable timeframe. The increase in interest rates coincides with the publication of the latest edition of the Monetary Bulletin (Peningamál). (The Monetary Bulletin, published on a quarterly basis, contains an “inflation and macroeconomic forecast along with comprehensive analysis of economic and monetary developments and prospects.”) As noted in the Bulletin, GDP growth exceeded November forecasts by 1%; GDP growth in 2021 was 4.9%, and the Central Bank predicts similar growth in 2022. “Jobs have continued to grow, unemployment has decreased, and the production slack that formed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to disappear. There is, however, considerable uncertainty.” The MPC states that inflation outlooks have worsened considerably since the committee’s last meeting. The headline inflation rate has risen to an estimated 4%. Furthermore, inflationary expectations have increased according to several indicators, with the rise in housing prices having a considerable effect, in addition to increases in several items of domestic expenditure. As reported by Kjarninn yesterday, Drífa Snædal, President of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, wrote a letter to the MPC yesterday asking it to refrain from raising interest rates. In her letter, Drífa stated that “sharp increases in interest rates have already put many households in a difficult spot. Many households have committed to non-indexed mortgages, owing both to favourable conditions and to indirect encouragement on behalf of the government and the Central Bank.” The Central Bank will hold a live broadcast at 9.30 AM.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0
957,Iceland Review,Reduction of Capelin Quota May Be Necessary,2022/02/03,"New measurements of capelin stocks from the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI) suggest that it might be necessary to reduce capelin quotas for the ongoing season by around 100,000 tonnes. This year’s quota was set at 904,200 tonnes and has not been higher in decades. MFRI’s final decision is expected by mid-February. In October 2021, the MFRI set a capelin catch quota for the 2021-2022 season at 904,000 tonnes following the autumn research expeditions. This quota was sevenfold that of the previous season’s quota, and a dramatic shift from 2019 and 2020, when no capelin catch quota was issued at all. The total landings of the 2020-2021 fishing year amounted to about 128,600 tonnes, among the lowest catches since 1980. Still, its export value amounted to 20 billion ISK [$154,500,000, €133,140,000]. Research vessels Árni Friðriksson and Bjarni Sæmundsson recently completed an expedition to assess the state of capelin stocks. The data collected suggest a total catch quota of 800,000 tonnes, which would be a 11% reduction from the previously issued quota. The recommendation is based on measurements taken off the Northeast, East, and Southeast coasts. Sea ice delayed measurements in the Westfjords region, which are expected to be done next week. A final quota recommendation will be issued after that expedition is complete. Capelin fishing has gone well this season, with two ships breaking records for the largest ever catch in Iceland.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
958,Iceland Review,"Largest Catch in Icelandic History – 3,400 Tonnes",2022/02/01,"Fishing vessel Börkur NK likely broke an Icelandic record when it landed 3,409 tonnes of capelin in Seyðisfjörður last week. The capelin had been caught over four days, and it took 18 hours to transfer it onto land. There are only two other vessels in the Icelandic fleet that could land a catch of similar size. Fish processing company Síldarvinnslan hf. posted about the catch last week, saying that only Börkur’s sister ship Vilhelm Þorsteinsson EA, as well as Beitir NK, would have the capacity to land such a large catch (with Beitir having significantly less cargo space than the other two ships). Eggert Ólafur Einarsson, factory manager of Síldvarvinnslan in Seyðisfjörður, says the capelin is high-grade. “This is quality material and the processing is going very well. There’s good fishing now and the processing is going very well,” Eggert stated, adding that the company was preparing to land from another vessel, Barði. Capelin catch quotas issued by the Icelandic Marine and Freshwater Research Institute have fluctuated in recent years, with no quota at all being issued in the 2019-2020 season. Last year’s quota was issued late, but later increased several times after research expeditions detected more fish. Hálfdan Hálfdanarson, who sat in the captain’s chair when Börkur headed out to sea once more, stated that the crew’s spirits were high. “Everyone’s in high spirits here on board, since we’re experiencing a real capelin season.”",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
959,Iceland Review,Prices Expected to Keep Rising in Iceland,2022/01/31,"Commodity prices on world markets are at an all-time high and Iceland has not escaped the effects of that development, RÚV reports. Price increases are not expected to slow in Iceland in the coming months, according to Andrés Magnússon, CEO of the Icelandic Federation of Trade and Services (Icelandic: SÞV). Andrés says the Central Bank of Iceland has no tools at its disposal to combat rising prices. “We have not seen such increases during peacetime, those are the facts. All indexes, all commodity indices confirm it. No one would think that companies, whether large or small, in whatever form, could take this on [alone],” Andrés stated. “When there is such a large increase in the purchase price, it affects pricing, that’s nothing new.” He says the timing is particularly unfortunate in Iceland, as collective agreement negotiations are approaching. “The government must be concerned about this. We must draw attention to the fact that the government has already come to the aid of farmers, because fertiliser prices are doubling, apparently, and has given farmers a grant of ISK 700 million [$5.4 million, €4.9 million]. It will be interesting to see whether the government intends to come to the aid of the entire public, which will inevitably be affected by this.” Andrés says the Central Bank of Iceland has no tools to tackle so-called “imported inflation,” when the price of imports increases. “This is a situation we have no control over here [in Iceland] and the Central Bank has no tools or equipment in its arsenal to respond. So in that sense it’s entirely new, dealing with what we call imported inflation.” Social-Democratic Alliance MP Kristrún Frostadóttir stated that rising prices on the housing market played a big part in driving up inflation. “The largest part of the inflation that is above the inflation target is due to rising housing prices in these incredible times,” Krístrún stated, adding that the government could do more to address the issue. “A 17% increase in housing prices in one year is not normal and we are seeing this spread to other areas now. Now there is talk that domestic inflation is starting to pick up, why do you think that is? It’s because housing is the largest single item in individual accounting.”","Business,Society",1,0,0,0,1,0
960,Iceland Review,Nearly 100 Companies Overdue for Equal Pay Certification,2022/01/29,"Just under a quarter of the companies that are legally required to obtain equal pay certification still had yet to do so at the end of 2021. This according to new data published by the Directorate of Equality on Friday. A total of 415 companies should have completed certification by the end of 2021, but 94 (22.65%) of them had yet to do so. The equal pay certification mandate applies to any company that employs 25 or more workers on an annual basis, using the calendar year as a reference period. Per the government’s website, 147,000 employees, or roughly 80% of those who are active on the labour market, are covered by this mandate. The data shows that it is primarily companies with 90-149 employees that have yet to complete their certification. Fifty-eight of the 98 companies in this bracket, or 59.18%, are currently uncertified. Fifteen of the 54 qualifying municipalities (27.78%) have also yet to complete the certification. Equal pay certification became a legal mandate in July 2017, with the goal of “combating the gender pay gap and promoting gender equality in the labour market.” As of November 14, 2018, however, the grace period for companies to acquire certification was extended. Companies with an average of 250 employees or more were supposed to complete certification by December 31, 2019. Companies with an average of 150-249 employees were given until December 31, 2020. Companies with 90-142 employees had until December 31, 2021. Companies with 25-89 employees have until the end of this year. Per Friday’s announcement, however, the Directorate of Equality now believes that those companies that were supposed to complete the certification process by the end of 2019 and 2020 have been given “ample time” to do so. As such, the Directorate is currently preparing to announce its decision on the imposition of daily fines.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
961,Iceland Review,Majority of Icelandic Music Catalogue Sold to Universal Music,2022/01/24,"Iceland’s largest music label, Alda Music, has been bought by Universal Music/Ingrooves Music Group, the largest music corporation in the world, Vísir reports. The head of Iceland’s Musicians’ Union expects the acquisition to give Icelandic musicians “bigger speakers” and open doors for them abroad. The purchase directly impacts the majority of music released in Iceland as well as the local music industry as a whole. Alda Music was founded in 2016 by musicians Sölvi Blöndal and Ólafur Arnalds. The label purchased the rights to a large catalogue of Icelandic music previously belonging to Sena, including the music of current and decades-old hit artists. Alda, and now Ingrooves, hold the rights to 80% of all music released in Iceland, according to the company’s own figures. “In just a few years, Sölvi and his team at Alda have built Iceland’s most powerful distribution network with an incredible roster of local artists,” Bob Roback of Ingrooves stated on the purchase. “We are looking forward to working closely with them as we invest in the local music community and expand opportunities for artists both within Iceland and around the world.” The purchase could help increase value in the Icelandic music by increasing its reach abroad, according to Gunnar Hrafnsson, chairman of the Musician’s Union of Iceland (FÍH). “I think [Icelandic music] has got bigger speakers now. There is more capital behind it and a more powerful company.” Others in the industry may have more reservations about the sale. “Important to think about and discuss this news of a foreign company’s purchase of the distribution rights to a large portion of Icelandic music,” Icelandic musician Logi Pedro Stefánsson tweeted today. “As a small nation with a tiny language we have to stand guard over our cultural wealth and legacy, and how we support the arts as well as possible in the future.” It is clear the purchase will greatly impact the Icelandic music industry, Bragi Valdimar Skúlason, chairman of the Composer’s Rights Society of Iceland (STEF), told Fréttablaðið. “There are of course huge interests at stake here. There is a remarkable catalogue of Icelandic songs from the very start [of recording].” Bragi Valdimar points out that musicians still hold the rights to the songs themselves, though Universal has acquired the rights to the masters (or recordings). This could be positive for STEF, as Universal will invest in distributing the recordings. What impact the purchase of Alda will have is yet to be seen, Bragi Valdimar added, but it is just one step of a development that has been ongoing for some time, and not only in Iceland. “It’s been something of a trend that these independent labels have a tendency to merge together in the end.”","Business,Culture",1,1,0,0,0,0

Owners will soon be able to apply for a so-called “rebound” grant up to a maximum of ISK 10-12 million [$77,900-93,400, €68,500-82,200], Foreign Affairs Minister Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir stated following a cabinet meeting this morning. “We’re doing this specifically for those parties who have a liquor licence and have experienced a loss of income due to [COVID-19] infection prevention measures,” Þórdís told reporters. Asked whether the grants would be enough to keep bars and restaurants running, the Minister stated that she could not be the judge, but she believed the initiative would make a big difference. The government has also postponed insurance and tax payment deadlines for restaurants in order to ease financial strain on the industry. The rebound grants are expected to cost the government around ISK 1.5 billion [$116.8 million, €102.7 million]. Þórdís stated that the government was also considering measures in support of freelance and culture workers, other groups that have been hit hard by pandemic restrictions. Icelandic authorities tightened domestic COVID-19 restrictions last week, closing bars and clubs and extending operational restrictions on restaurants as the country fights its biggest ever wave of COVID-19 infection. Some restaurateurs have criticised the closures and restrictions, pointing to the fact that schools remain open, despite being a source of infection spread. Bragi Skaftason, who operates three restaurants in Reykjavík, has stated that reintroducing partial employment benefits, a pandemic response measure the government has discontinued, would be more helpful to restaurateurs than the government’s current economic response measures.","Business,Politics",1,0,0,1,0,0

Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir, who is acting Minister of Finance in the absence of Bjarni Benediktson, said that there isn’t much work left to be done on the proposal and she hopes that it will be on Monday’s parliamentary agenda. She noted that the relief measures come as a result of conversations with people in the events, tourism, restaurant, and cultural sectors. “What we’re doing right now is primarily focused on restaurants,” she stated. “[…] But we need to be mindful of the economy as a whole remaining strong.

964,Iceland Review,Residents and Local Council Oppose Silicon Plant Reopening,2022/01/13,"Arion Bank has plans to sell the silicon plant in Helguvík, Southwest Iceland, to PCC BakkiSilicon. The two parties have signed a statement of intent for the sale. Kjarninn reports that both residents and municipal authorities oppose the reopening of the plant. The plant opened in 2016, but was quickly plagued by operational troubles and ultimately went bankrupt amidst widespread community outcry over the environmental and health impact it was having on the surrounding communities.  “The Municipal Council of Reykjanesbær has repeatedly expressed its views on the operation of the silicon plant to Arion Bank,” local councillor Friðjón Einarsson stated, adding that there is opposition both among residents and local councillors to opening the plant. “We have formally requested to work with with the bank to dismantle the plant and start collaborating on developing employment in Helguvík. Unfortunately, that has not happened.” Arion Bank has drawn up plans to renovate, reopen, and expand the plant. The Icelandic National Planning Agency (Skipulagsstofnun) released a report on those plans on December 31, 2021, which stated that the changes would likely reduce malfunctions at the plant, a repeated issue when the plant was still in operation. The report also stated that while the renovations would lessen the plant’s impact on air quality, the impact would still be negative in the first phase of operation and quite negative if all four ovens were to operate at once.

965,Iceland Review,Coastal Fishermen Unhappy With Reduced Cod Quota,2022/01/12,"Small boat fishermen in Iceland are unhappy with the government’s decision to reduce their cod fishing quota from 10,000 tonnes down to 8,500 for the coming summer season, Vísir reports. Arthúr Bogason, chairman of the National Union of Small Boat Owners (Landssamband smábátaeigenda) says the government has not provided any data to support the decision and hopes it will be reconsidered. A meeting with Fisheries Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir on the matter was inconclusive. Arthúr says he does not know whether the decision to reduce the quota was made in the Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture or by the Directorate of Fisheries (Fiskistofa) but the union is working to find out. However, since the decision was made on December 21, the phone at the union office has not stopped ringing. He adds that the Left-Green Movement, the party to which Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Svandís Svavarsdóttir belongs, has supported coastal fishermen in the past and worked to improve their conditions. The decision comes across as change of direction from the party. Arthúr brought up the issue in a meeting with Svandís one week ago. He stated that although the discussion went well and the union expects fruitful collaboration with the incoming minister. Last year a total of 670 fishermen held coastal fishing licences. Coastal fishing is not an easy job, according to Arthúr, but the number of fishermen in the field has remained relatively steady since 2009, when the current regulations governing coastal fishing were implemented. The regulations permit all fishermen to fish in coastal waters provided they fulfill certain requirements, which Arthúr describes as extensive. “Certain politicians predicted [coastal fishing] would explode. That thousands would sign up and it was best avoided.” However, since the current system was implemented, the number of fishermen has fluctuated between 600 and 726, according to Arthúr. “While handline fishing is romantic, there’s a lot of hard work and sweat and tears mixed in with the romance,” he stated.","Business,Nature,Politics",1,0,1,1,0,0
966,Iceland Review,More Icelandic Horses Exported This Year Than Ever,2021/12/23,"More than 3000 horses have been exported this year, an increase of more than 1000 since last year. This is a record high in export numbers and more than double the export numbers of just two years ago. The last record was set in 1996 when 2,841 Icelandic horses were exported in one year, but in 2010-2019 the numbers ranged from 1100-1500. This year, 3,341 horses have left Iceland, 361 studs, 1,426 geldings, and 1,554 mares. Of these, 845 horses were certified A, meaning that both the horse and its parents had undergone DNA analysis proving its family history. The top three export countries are Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, with 2,467 of the total exported horses, Germany alone receiving 1,477. This is according to data from Worldfengur, published by The Icelandic Agricultural Advisory Centre. Once they’ve left Iceland, the horses can never return. Importing horses is prohibited to protect the Icelandic horse breed that has lived in isolation in Iceland for centuries.

967,Iceland Review,Play Launches Flights to the US Next Spring,2021/12/17,"The Icelandic airline Play will begin offering flights to the US next spring. The airline will add three new aircraft to its fleet next year. As reported by Business Insider, the Icelandic airline PLAY has received initial approval from the US Department of Transportation to operate flights to the US. Tickets to the US went on sale yesterday. Play will begin flying to Washington/Baltimore on April 20 and Boston starting May 11. It will thereby become the third carrier to offer flights to the US; Icelandair offers flights to over a dozen destinations in the States, and the US airlines Delta and United are currently offering flights to the States in the summer. Speaking to RÚV yesterday, Play’s CEO Birgir Jónsson suggested that the airline would continue to focus on low prices – “a comfortable, clean, and secure way of transport,” as he remarked in his interview with Business Insider, as opposed to “an experience.” “It’s always been our aim to operate according to this model,” Birgir said to RÚV. “We’ve seen that what matters most in this business are ticket prices and, therefore, operational costs. We believe that we can secure our place in the market by offering the lowest prices.” Birgir added that he was not afraid of Icelandair responding to Play’s foray into the US market by lowering its prices – that lower prices would benefit all consumers. According to the flight schedule, Play will offer daily flights to the abovementioned destinations in spring, leaving Iceland in the afternoon and returning on the following mornings. As has been widely reported, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the airline industry. Birgir remains hopeful, however, that the state of affairs vis-a-vis the pandemic will have improved by next summer. “I think most of us expect the tourism industry to return to normal next summer, but like before, we must proceed cautiously; we’ll begin by offering flights to two new destinations and go from there.” With the addition of the three new aircraft next year, Play’s fleet will number six aeroplanes, and four new aircraft are expected to be added in 2023. When asked about the impact of COVID-19 on the airline’s operations, Birgir stated that it’s had its effect but that bookings have been steady: “All in all, we’re happy with the reception and how things have progressed.”","Business,Travel",1,0,0,0,0,0
968,Iceland Review,Log4j Vulnerability in Iceland: Uncertainty Phase Declared,2021/12/14,"The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management has declared an uncertainty phase due to the Log4j vulnerability affecting computer networks worldwide. Since last week, Icelandic authorities have been working to minimise the damage the vulnerability could potentially cause. The Log4j vulnerability primary affects businesses by putting their computer systems at risk of hacking. “The severity of the vulnerability lies first and foremost in how widespread the Log4j code library is and the depth and richness of the access it can provide to internal systems,” according to a notice from the Civil Protection Department. The notice points out that the vulnerability is not unique to Iceland but a global problem. “The public does not have to be particularly afraid of it regarding their home computers or mobile phones. However, it is always a good rule of thumb to update your virus protection and other software as soon as updates are announced.” Network and computer system operators in Iceland are encouraged to review all systems where the vulnerability could be present and updated them as soon as updates are available. Authorities also underline the importance of monitoring systems following an update in order to assess whether there are indications that the vulnerability was used to install malware while the systems were weak. The National Police Commissioner declared the uncertainty phase after consultation with computer emergency response team CERT-IS and the Electronic Communications Office of Iceland (ECOI). The Civil Protection Department and CERT-IS have activated their response plan for the protection of essential information infrastructure due to the vulnerability.","Business,Sci&Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0
969,Iceland Review,Electricity Shortage in Iceland Impacts Local Industry and Data Centres,2021/12/08,"Iceland’s National Power Company has made a sudden decision to reduce electricity supply to industrial operations, including fishmeal factories, aluminium smelters, and data centres, RÚV reports. The decision was made due to an energy shortage caused by a series of issues, including a problem at a power station, low hydro reservoir levels, and limited transmission capacity. The affected companies have either had to reduce operations or switch to other power sources such as oil. The National Power Company initially stated that cuts would be made in January, but decided yesterday that the supply would be reduced immediately. Sigríður Mogensen of The Federation of Icelandic Industries (SI) says the cuts have had an immediate effect on data centres. “We know of cases where Icelandic data centres have unfortunately had to close down customer service [yesterday]; early in the morning after this information became available. That means an immediate loss of revenue and we can keep in mind that the data processing industry generates at least ISK 20 billion in foreign exchange earnings for the national economy annually.” Iceland’s abundance of low-cost, renewable energy and low average temperatures that minimise the need for cooling systems have made it an attractive destination for data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in recent years. Sigríður added that the current cuts could have a long-term impact on the industry by leading potential customers to question energy security in Iceland. “This main this is that this is a definite loss for the economy and we need to learn the lesson from this to plan further ahead.” CEO of Síldarvinnslan fishmeal factories, located in East Iceland, says the cuts will not impact production levels but will affect cost for the company, which will have to rely on oil for power. “Oil prices are high at the moment, whereas the price of electricity has taken into account that it is curtailable as it is now. So this will bring a rise in cost.” The capelin season is around the corner, meaning that fishmeal factories will have high energy needs.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
970,Iceland Review,"Up to a Third of Catch Discarded, Drone Surveillance Reveals",2021/12/07,"With the help of drone surveillance, Iceland’s Directorate of Fisheries has discovered ten times as many discard cases in the fishing industry in 2021 than in 2020. So far this year, the Directorate has processed at least 120 cases involving fishing companies, both large and small, that have discarded catch back into the ocean. Some of the cases involved the discard of two or more fish per minute and up to one third of a vessel’s total catch. Kjarninn reported first. Until 2021, the Directorate of Fisheries recorded around 10 cases of discard annually. Since introducing drone surveillance at the beginning of this year, that number has increased more than tenfold. The vast majority of these cases concluded with a written letter from the Directorate of Fisheries stating that catch should not be thrown back into the sea, while one case resulted in the temporary suspension of a fishing licence and three with formal warnings. The drone surveillance is mostly carried out from land, and as a consequence, the cases mostly involve smaller or medium-sized vessels that fish closer to the shore. Some drone surveillance was carried out from ships last spring, however. Four of this year’s cases involve bottom trawlers of the largest size. Elín Björg Ragnarsdóttir, head of the Directorate of Fisheries’ surveillance department, told RÚV that the spike in cases likely does not reflect an increase in the practice of discarding catch, rather simply that more instances are being discovered, though this cannot be confirmed. Discards constitute the portion of a catch of fish that is thrown back into the ocean and not retained on board a fishing vessel. The percentage of such fish that survives the process varies by species. Fish may be discarded due to being an unmarketable species, being below minimum landing size, or being fish that cannot be landed due to quota restrictions. Discard in the North Sea, for example, has been estimated at nearly 1 million tonnes annually, one-third of the total weight landed each year. Discarding catch at sea is illegal according to Icelandic law. Icelandic regulations require fishing vessels to retain most fish for which quotas have been set or species for which a market exists.","Business,Nature",1,0,1,0,0,0
971,Iceland Review,Iceland’s Tuna Quota Mostly Unused,2021/11/30,"Between 20 and 30 Japanese tuna fishing ships have been fishing just outside the borders of Icelandic waters, indicating that there is enough tuna for fishing within Icelandic jurisdiction, RÚV reports. Icelandic authorities release a tuna fishing quota, but it has rarely been used in recent years. Icelandic fishermen would need to acquire special ships in order to make tuna fishing commercially viable. Japanese ships have fished for tuna in the North Atlantic for decades, but how far north they venture varies. Around 15-20 years ago, it was common for Japanese ships to dock in Reykjavík harbour for provisions. According to information from the Icelandic Coast Guard, some of the Japanese ships that have been fishing near the Icelandic jurisdiction in recent years have been granted permission to enter into Icelandic waters due to weather and sea conditions. The quota given this year is 225 tonnes and it is mostly unused. Fishing company Vísir, based in Grindavík, Southwest Iceland, is one of the few Icelandic companies that has fished tuna, and did so for three years. “Not everyone agreed that it was profitable but we enjoyed it and gained valuable experience in those three years,” states the company’s CEO Pétur Hafsteinn Pálsson. “As fun as it was in the beginning, the excitement wore off when the weather started to worsen and the catch to decrease, [the tuna] seemed to swim out again and didn’t come as near to land.” Vísir used wet fish trawlers to fish tuna, slightly adapting them for the purpose. The fish were sent to Japan by air. Now that the tuna is further from land, specially-equipped freezer trawlers would be required to store the fish, and no such ships are currently available in Iceland. “First of all you have to freeze it at a much lower temperature than a regular fishing boat can do, so you need both a very low temperature and quick freezing,” Pétur stated. While tuna fishing isn’t entirely out of the picture sometime in the future, the pandemic has delayed all such projects in the industry.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
972,Iceland Review,First Ever Cases of Infectious Salmon Anaemia in Iceland,2021/11/29,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) has found evidence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in an open-net salmon farm in Reyðarfjörður fjord, East Iceland. ISA is a highly infectious viral disease that has no treatment and causes high mortality in farmed Atlantic salmon. This is the first time the virus has been diagnosed in Icelandic waters. The virus has been diagnosed in a salmon farm owned by Laxar fiskeldi ehf. Follow-up tests are now being conducted to confirm the diagnosis. A decision has been made to slaughter all of the fish in the pen where the virus was detected. Fish in the farm’s other pens appear to be healthy, according to the notice from MAST. It will, however, be closely monitored in the near future. The ISA virus is harmless to humans and is not transmitted through fish products. It is also known as “salmon flu,” and belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family of influenza viruses and has most of the characteristics of influenza viruses known in mammals and birds. A benign variant of the virus is widespread and “probably found everywhere in salmons’ environment,” according to the notice from MAST. The pathogenic ISA virus, like the one that has now been detected in Iceland for the first time, is created by mutation of the benign variant. The first case of ISA was detected in Norway in 1984. Since then it has been detected in many other salmon farming nations, including Canada (1996), Scotland (1998), the Faroe Islands (2000), the USA (2001), Chile (2001), and Ireland (2002). “The diagnosis of the virus emphasises the importance of monitoring and infection control in order to maintain good disease status in Iceland and prevent diseases such as ISA emerge and get a foothold in salmon farms,” the MAST statement concludes.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0
973,Iceland Review,MAST Reviewing Footage of Mistreated Mares in Youtube Doc,2021/11/23,"The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority is currently reviewing footage from a Youtube documentary that features clips of Icelandic mares being mistreated during blood-collection procedures. The conditions and conduct caught on camera are “utterly unacceptable,” says the Chairman of the Horse Breeders Association of Iceland. On November 19, Tierschutzbund Zürich (TSB, Switzerland) and the Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF, Germany) posted a documentary to Youtube under the heading “Iceland – Land of the 5,000 Blood Mares.” The documentary reports on the activities within so-called “blood farms” in Iceland, where blood is drawn from mares in early pregnancy to extract ECG (previously known as pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin or PMSG): a hormone commonly used in concert with progestogens to induce ovulation in livestock prior to artificial insemination. The documentary features footage from hidden cameras showing workers beating and shouting at horses. The filmmakers claim to have discovered “widespread animal-welfare violations” in Iceland, which run counter to claims made by pharmaceutical companies on the nature of blood-collection procedures in the country. As noted by MAST, the extraction of ECG from pregnant mares is a growing industry in Iceland; blood from almost 5,400 mares, on 119 farms, has been drawn in 2021. Following coverage of the documentary in the media, various parties connected to blood-collection farms in Iceland have commented publicly. In a press release on Sunday, Ísteka – which manufactures pharmaceuticals from the blood of mares – denounced the treatment of the animals in the documentary: “Ísteka disapproves strongly of sourcing practices that do not comply with the high animal welfare standards we work by and that we recommend to our customers and colleagues. We have immediately started an internal supplier review to investigate the allegations and cannot comment any further on this at this time.” In an interview with Vísir, farmer Sæunn Þórarinsdóttir criticized the footage recorded on her property on the grounds that it lacked context. “None of my operations have anything to do with what is seen in that video,” she stated.  Sæunn further alleged that the documentarians misrepresented reality on several occasions. (Early on in the video, for example, the documentarians say that they’re being followed by a veterinarian driving a grey jeep. “The veterinarian in question was simply on his way home,” Sæunn told Vísir.) “The footage is horrible to watch and not at all an accurate depiction of our operations. We have a complete ban on violence; I would personally beat anyone who laid a finger on my horses,” Sæunn remarked. In a public statement released yesterday, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) announced that it was reviewing the footage seen in the documentary. “The procedures caught on film appear to violate operational conditions, which stipulate the horses’ welfare be ensured.” In the statement, MAST stressed that the supervision of blood-collection procedures is a priority. “Since the regulation on the welfare of horses came into effect in 2014, MAST has established clear conditions for blood-extraction procedures performed on pregnant mares, and we have gradually ramped up supervision.” According to the statement, MAST inspectors pay annual visits to a fifth of blood-collecting farms in Iceland during the time that procedures are being performed. “If, during inspections, serious deviations from protocol are noted, operations are stopped; the operations of five facilities has been halted since 2014.” In an interview with the radio station Rás 2 this morning, Sveinn Steinarsson, Chairman of the Horse Breeders Association of Iceland, stated that it was clear that the horses in the video had been mistreated: blood-collection is a sensitive procedure that demands great care. “The extraction of blood from pregnant mares has been practiced for almost 40 years and the fact that the operating conditions are, after all this time – and given especially how extensive these operations have become – so unsatisfactory is utterly unacceptable,” Sveinn remarked in the interview. While he condemned the mistreatment of mares in the documentary, Sveinn warned against generalization: “I expect that conditions are acceptable in most places, but, as it stands, our discussion is beginning with the lowest-common denominator.” Sveinn concluded by stating that those who were charged with the supervision of blood-collection procedures in Iceland had many questions to answer. “As far as what is depicted in the documentary, I expect no stone to be left unturned.” This article was updated at 15:17.",Business,1,0,0,0,0,0

975,Iceland Review,‘Working Quarantine’ for Icelandic Football Teams,2020/08/20,"Icelandic club football teams that travel to Europe to play in international matches may undergo a ‘working quarantine,’ Vísir reports. This means they are allowed to practice together during the mandatory five-day quarantine between COVID-19 tests. This was confirmed on Thursday by Víðir Reynisson, Chief Superintendent of Civil Protection in Iceland. Football teams must apply in advance to do a working quarantine after their return from matches abroad, so it is unclear if the KR football team will be allowed to practice together over the coming days. KR returned to Iceland on Tuesday night after playing a match against Celtic in Glasgow, Scotland. The team Breiðablik has applied for permission to do a working quarantine after returning from a match in Noway next week, and Víkingur R. intends to do the same in advance of their trip to Slovenia. The fact that teams are allowed to train together while in working quarantine doesn’t change anything where match play against other local teams is concerned. There will still be no league matches during the five-day quarantine period. The working quarantine regulations may also allow for FC Valur to host a qualifying match for to European Championships, scheduled to take place in October. Valur has applied for permission to do so. FH will be playing a match against a Slovakian team in Hafnafjörður next week; according to Víðir, the Slovakian team will be allowed to arrive in Iceland the day before their match. Similarly, national teams—such as Iceland’s men’s national team and that of England, who will play against one another at Laugardalsvöllur on September 5, will be allowed to enter the country right before match day and will not be subject to the five-day quarantine and double COVID test regulations. “There are different regulations for this,” Víðir explained. “They are entering this ‘bubble,’ you could call it, which is created around these UEFA matches. Such that teams enter it while abroad—undergo screening abroad before they arrive in Iceland and are basically in quarantine before they get here. So they are tested here at the border and are allowed to train and play matches within the five-day timeframe if necessary.” ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

979,Iceland Review,Icelandic CrossFitters Criticize CEO’s Reponse to Protests,2020/06/09,"Following CrossFit’s controversial response to protests surrounding the death of George Floyd, Icelandic CrossFitters have taken to social media to criticize company leadership. The Icelandic gym CrossFit Reykjavík has also threatened to drop their affiliation with CrossFit unless “drastic changes are made.” CrossFit is a branded fitness regimen and competitive sport founded by Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai in 2000. Since its founding, CrossFit has enjoyed increasing popularity around the world. In 2005, the company was affiliated with 13 gyms. Today, it is estimated that CrossFit is practised by members of over 13,000 gyms worldwide. There are several CrossFit affiliated gyms in Iceland. Following protests centring around the death of American citizen George Floyd at the hands of police officer Derek Chauvin, CrossFit CEO Greg Glassman came under fire for a series of controversial tweets. On June 6, after the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (a public health body) stated that racism was a public health issue on Twitter, Glassman responded by tweeting: “FLOYD-19.” Three days earlier, Alyssa Royse – the owner of Rocket CrossFit, a nine-year affiliate gym – announced her intention of changing Rocket CrossFit’s name to Rocket Community Fitness and disaffiliating from CrossFit when it was time to renew. Among the reasons for her decision, was CrossFit’s failure to take a stand. “The George Floyd murder threw our country into massive unrest. CrossFit is the only major brand I can think of that has failed to take a stand, make a statement, show support for social justice in general and Black lives in specific,” Royse wrote. Glassman’s reply, later shared by Royse, stated that he sincerely believed that the quarantine had “adversely impacted” her mental health. The email went on to call Royse “delusional” and a “shitty person.” On June 7, Reebok announced that it would not be extending its contract as the sponsor for the CrossFit Games. That same day, sports scientist and performance director Mike Young published an article on Medium alleging that Glassman had repeatedly stated, “I do not mourn George Floyd,” to a Minneapolis CrossFit gym owner on a group video conference call. Glassman later issued an apology on Twitter: “I, CrossFit HQ, and the CrossFit community will not stand for racism. I made a mistake by the words I chose yesterday. My heart is deeply saddened by the pain it has caused. It was a mistake, not racist but a mistake. Floyd is a hero in the black community and not just a victim. I should have been sensitive to that and wasn’t. I apologize for that.” In response to the scandal, Iceland CrossFit athletes have taken to social media and a few CrossFit gyms in Iceland, including CrossFit Reykjavík, are considering dropping their affiliation. Writing on Instagram yesterday, Annie Mist Þórisdóttir – winner of the CrossFit Games in 2011 and 2012 – criticized the company’s response to the protests: “I have ALWAYS been true to myself on social media – and I will continue to be. CrossFit is the community NOT just the brand. CrossFit much more than just ONE individual. CrossFit is ALL of US. CrossFit is universally scaleable, CrossFit has room for everyone regardless of colour, gender, or sexual orientation.”  A post shared by Annie Thorisdottir (@anniethorisdottir) on Jun 7, 2020 at 3:26pm PDT  In a similar message on Instagram on the same day, Katrín Tanja Davíðsdóttir – who followed in her compatriot’s footsteps by placing first in the CrossFit Games in 2015 and 2016 – said that she was “ashamed, disappointed, and angry.” Referencing Glassman’s “Floyd-19” comment and his reply to Alyssa Royse, Katrín Tanja stated: “This is something that I DO NOT STAND FOR. This is not leadership. This is not good human nature.”   .

He has been the defending champion of the Arnold Strongman Classic three years running. Hafþór’s record-setting was little reported on in Iceland, where he is a controversial figure. In 2017, two Icelandic companies reconsidered their promotional contracts with the strongman when several of his ex-girlfriends came forward with allegations of domestic abuse. One of them, Thelma Björk Steimann, also the mother of Hafþór’s child, described years of sexual violence she was subjected to by Hafþór in an interview that same year. Hafþór has denied all the accusations. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

The website Hlaupum kringum hnött­inn, or ‘Let’s Run Around the World,’ was started by a group of Icelanders looking to do “something constructive to lift our moods during the epidemic.” Participants are encouraged to log the kilometres they jog every day and take part in a virtual trip around the globe—” with a distance of two metres between runners,” of course. The race kicked off on Monday this week, and at time of writing, 771 participants had run 6,033 km or 13% of the way around the world. The route started in Reykjavík before making its next stops in Þórshöfn, Glasgow, London, Paris, Florence, and Athens. Next up are Adis Ababa, Nairobi, Johannesburg, and the South Pole. Each participant has run an average of 7.8 km a day thus far. Þórlindur Kjartansson, one of the site’s founders, says that a project like this is all the more necessary while the gathering ban is in effect and people need to be prioritizing both their physical and mental health. The group doesn’t yet know how the race will continue after the round-the-world goal has been reached, but plans to keep the site up and running until Iceland is no longer in a state of emergency due to COVID-19.

983,Iceland Review,Two Cross-Country Skiers Rescued in North Iceland,2020/03/06,"The Dalbjörg Search and Rescue squad in Eyjafjörður in North Iceland came to the aid of two skiers who got stranded while trying to cross the highlands. RÚV reports that the skiers had registered a detailed travel plan at safetravel.is which greatly aided rescuers in locating them and bringing them to safety. The skiers intended to cross the highlands from north to south. However, on Thursday, one of them got wet and very cold during the expedition, which prevented the pair from either going back the way they came or continuing on their journey. They sent word to a contact in Canada, who in turn, got in touch with Icelandic authorities to request assistance on their behalf. The information that ICE-SAR received from this third party was unclear, but happily, the skiers had registered a detailed itinerary on that made it possible for rescuers to pinpoint their location without difficulty. Two ICE-SAR volunteers on snowmobiles left from Eyjafjörður on Thursday afternoon to find the skiers, who were taking shelter in a tent east of Urðarvatn lake. At the time of writing, a rescue vehicle was on the way to transport the skiers back to Akureyri.   ","Society,Sport",0,0,0,0,1,1

Starting at 7pm, brightly clad participants will set out from the Reykjavík Art Museum on a 5 km trot through downtown, which will be illuminated for the occasion. Runners will all get their very own light-up gear as well, making them “part of the entire show from start to finish.” The Northern Lights Run is part of the Reykjavík Winter Lights Festival, which has been part of the city’s event calendar for the last 18 years. Billed as an event dedicated to “feeling healthy, having fun, and spending an amazing night out with friends and/or family,” the run isn’t timed but is expected to take anywhere between 20 and 70 minutes. The course runs past Harpa, through Hallgrímskirkja, past Hljómskálinn by Tjörnin pond, through City Hall, and ends back at the Reykjavík Art Museum on Tryggvagata. DJs will be set up at “fun stations” along the route and there will be a dance party at the art museum at the end of the event. The route will be closed to traffic throughout the event. All participants must register for the event and are reminded to dress for the weather in bright, reflective colours so that they can easily be seen in the dark. Runners and walkers may not bring their dogs, but prams and strollers are acceptable, as long as they are fitted with reflectors or lights. Walkers are asked to stay to the right so that people moving faster can pass on the left. Find more information on the Northern Lights Run website, here. ","Culture,Society,Sport",0,1,0,0,1,1
985,Iceland Review,John Snorri Cancels K2 Climb,2020/02/06,"Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson has cancelled his planned climb of K2, the world’s second-highest mountain. John was hoping to be the first person ever to climb the mountain during winter. The decision to cancel the ascent was made after two members of John’s team expressed they did not feel fully prepared for the expedition. “Summiting K2 in winter is a formidable task that necessitates all team members being fully prepared, both mentally and physically, to face the challenge,” John Snorri wrote in a Facebook post yesterday announcing the decision. “Team members Mingma G of Nepal and Ga Li of China have both expressed that they don’t feel fully prepared to make the scheduled attempt of personal reason [sic]. Taking this into consideration and after much deliberation, it has been decided that the mission will not go forward.” In an interview with mbl.is, John’s wife Lína Móey Björnsdóttir stated that John had been ready to go ahead with the expedition, despite two members of the team dropping out. The decision to cancel the trip was made when the five other team members did not trust themselves to continue under the changed circumstances. “There have to be more of them,” Lína explained. “The ice on the mountain, as he described it to me, is like safety glass. You have to kick it four to five times with crampons and the ice axe to get a grip. They would quickly get very tired and would have to always be taking turns and doing it together. They could have never done it just three.” Lína said John Snorri was already on his way to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, and would be home in Iceland after the weekend. “It was a big disappointment for him to have to cancel the trip,” she stated.

986,Iceland Review,Icelanders Disappoint the Danes at 2020 Euro,2020/01/16,"The Hungarian national handball team defeated Iceland in the teams’ final game of the 2020 Euro group stages. As a result of the Icelanders’ loss, the Danish national team was eliminated from the competition. The Danish press expressed its disappointment following the Danish exit, Vísir reports. Following a six-goal loss against Hungary yesterday, the Icelandic national handball team advances to the main round of the 2020 Euro (with zero points). As noted by the Danish Jyllands-Posten, “what Hungary and Iceland have in common is that they will play their first game of the main rounds on Friday. Denmark will not.” The Danish press has criticised the performance of the Danish national team ever since its loss against Iceland last Saturday. The criticism continued yesterday. The Danes did, however, secure a consolation victory against Russia yesterday – in a game that, as far as the competition went, meant nothing. “No help: Danes exit the Euro,” a headline from Ekstra Bladet reads. Other observations include, “Iceland couldn’t help the Danes” and “the Danes needed the Icelanders’ help to advance to the main round, but no such thing happened.” Claus Møller Jakobsen, a commentator with TV 2 Sport, agrees that there is no other word for the Danes’ performance than “fiasco.” “There’s no doubt that this is a fiasco. Denmark has, in two games, not displayed the quality the team possesses.” Iceland will face off against Slovenia tomorrow at 3 pm in the team’s first match in the main rounds. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

As Iceland won its opening match against Denmark on Saturday, the team has secured four points after two rounds. Shortly after Iceland’s match against Russia, Olympic Champions Denmark faced off against Hungary – desperately needing a win; Denmark had zero points after a first-round loss against Iceland. Hungary, on the other hand, had secured two points following a narrow win against Russia. Securing an early advantage, Hungary maintained their lead for almost the entire match. With only a few minutes remaining of the game, the Hungarians were leading by two goals (23:21). The Danes mustered a comeback, scoring three goals in quick succession (23:24). In the final moments of the game, Hungarian Zoltan Szita equalised. Danish captain Mikkel Hansen had the opportunity of securing a Danish win, but goalkeeper Roland Mikler rebuffed his attempt. Final score 24:24. Denmark’s loss means that Iceland sits atop Group E with four points, Hungary has three points, Denmark has one point and Russia zero points. Iceland is, therefore, the only team in Group E that has advanced to the main round. The final round of the group stages will take place next Wednesday, January 15. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

Team captain Guðjón Valur Sigurðsson, who turned 40 last summer, will be competing at the EURO for the eleventh time. In an interview yesterday, Guðjón Valur expressed his gratitude for still being able to compete at the highest level. The 2020 EHF European Men’s Handball Championship will take place between January 9 to January 26.

At a press conference held at Alvogen headquarters in Reykjavík yesterday afternoon, Iceland Review spoke to captain Guðjón Valur Sigurðsson. He will be competing at the EURO for the eleventh time. No other Icelandic handball player has participated in the competition as often. Guðjón Valur admitted that a lot had changed in his roughly twenty-year career with the national team. “You learn from the mistakes you’ve made; from the coaches and the teams you’ve played with; from the poor performances; from that meal you ate too close to game time. As you grow older, you begin focusing more on sleep, diet, mental health. Everything. Whether that’s experience speaking or just me getting older and more emotional – I can’t say. Hopefully, you grow wiser, smarter, and more crafty as you grow older. It would be a shame if I were making the same mistakes today as when I was twenty.” Guðjón Valur played his first match with the national team in December 1999. No other outfield player has played as many matches for the national team. Guðjón Valur is also the highest-scoring handball player in the history of the national team. “I have learned a lot from having spent my entire life as a handball player.” When asked about the biggest change, in terms of stepping onto the court today as compared to 20 years ago, Guðjón Valur spoke of gratitude. “Today, I’m just grateful for being able to do this. I don’t take it for granted anymore. When one is 20, 25 years old, everything is a piece of cake. One stays up later, sleeps less, and can eat hamburgers and hot-dogs every meal. When one reaches one’s forties, however, sleep becomes more important. So does spending time with family.” ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

The ambitious hike is a fundraising venture for his planned trip up K2, the world’s second-highest mountain. John Snorri plans to be the first to top the mountain in winter. He had planned to make the 14 trips in 28 hours, but an injury stopped him short. None the less, 8 trips up and down the Esja mountain in 18 hours is no small feat. The combined length of the 14 Esja climbs is slightly longer than what John Snorri will have to traverse to climb K2, which is 8,611 metres (28,251 feet) high. He invited friends and supporters to join him for one or more of the 14 hikes. Among his company on the first trip up was Dean Carriere, who climbed Manasla with John Snorri this fall: the world’s eighth-highest peak. John Snorri plans to start his K2 climb in January. When asked why he was setting out on the challenge, Snorri stated “Because I know I can do it and I want to see the Icelandic flag on the top of K2 in the winter. The first flag in the world, for it to be Icelandic. No one can take that away. It will always be the first flag that stood on K2 in wintertime.” John stopped the hike due to an inflammation in his right knee. “It’s no major issue but since there are only two weeks until I leave for Pakistan I thought it was sensible to not risk any further injuries. These sprints up and down the Esjan were mainly thought as both practice and for fundraising, but not to jeopardize the project,” John said in an announcement. John’s K2 trip is expected to cost between ISK 22-24 million ($180,000-196,000/€161,000-176,000).

The Icelandic men’s national football team stands in third place in their group so far with 15 points overall. Turkey and France stand in first and second with 19 points each. Iceland would need to win both its upcoming matches to ensure qualification, which would additionally depend on Turkey losing its match against Andorra.

When asked directly whether he’d been taking steroids, he told RÚV that “I have never taken steroids and in all likeliness, never will.” Hinrik Ingi appealed the drug test results in May, but his appeal was denied. He will, therefore, not be eligible to compete in any official CrossFit competitions until May 4, 2023. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
1000,Iceland Review,Iceland Beats Turkey 2-1 in Euro Qualifier,2019/06/12,"The Iceland men’s national football team beat Turkey 2-1 in a Euro qualifying match at Reykjavík’s Laugardalsvöllur stadium last night. Centre back Ragnar Sigurðsson scored both of the team’s goals. Iceland started the game strong, scoring their first goal only 21 minutes in. The second goal came only ten minutes later, giving Iceland a 2-0 lead. Turkish midfielder Dorukhan Toköz did not let that score stand for long, scoring for his team at 40 minutes into the game for a final result of 2-1 for Iceland’s team.

1001,Iceland Review,Turkey Denounces “Disrespectful” Treatment of Football Team at Airport,2019/06/10,"The Turkish government has issued a diplomatic note to Iceland denouncing what it is calling “disrespectful” and “violent” behaviour against the country’s men’s national football team, aa.com reports. The football team arrived in Keflavík airport on Sunday night in advance of their Euro 2020 qualifying match against Iceland on Tuesday. They claim that they were then subjected to excessive search and security measures at passport control and were held for around three hours before being allowed to leave the airport. A representative from Isavia, the company that owns and manages the Keflavík airport, told RÚV that per international regulations, airport employees were obliged to conduct a security check on the team and that it was more intensive because the flight on which the team arrived departed from an airport that is not part of the One Stop Security area whose security protocols apply to all airports in the EEA. Isavia maintains that as such, all of the passengers on the flight were subjected to the same security checks – including Icelanders. Isavia also says that the security checks took an unusually long time on Sunday night because passengers were traveling with a high number of electronic devices and liquids in their luggage, all of which needed to be individually screened. Isavia contests Turkey’s claims that players were held for three hours, however: they say that the security wait was 80 minutes from the time that the aircraft arrived. The flight arrived at 7.40pm, representatives say, and the last passenger went through customs at roughly 9.00pm. Feelings are running particularly high in the wake of the event, with some players on the Icelandic squad and Icelandic sports journalists even receiving threats over the matter. It’s likely that tensions were exacerbated during an interview that Turkish midfielder Emre Belozoglu gave after going through security; an individual who has since been identified and is presumed to be a Belgian national stuck a dishwashing brush in the player’s face like a microphone while he was being interviewed by reporters. Turkey and Iceland do not maintain embassies in each other’s countries, but Fazli Corman, Turkey’s ambassador in Norway, is apparently on his way to Iceland to follow up on the situation. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also posted about the incident on Twitter, saying “The treatment towards our national team at the Iceland airport is not acceptable in terms of both diplomatic and humanitarian practices.” ","Politics,Sport",0,0,0,1,0,1
1002,Iceland Review,"Iceland Wins Euro Qualifier Against Albania, 1-0",2019/06/09,"The Icelandic National Men’s football team won its Euro 2020 qualifying match against Albania on Saturday, with a final score of 1-0, mbl.is reports. Iceland earned three points as a result of the win. Although Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson, who scored the winning goal during the 22’ minute, admitted to Vísir that the game “wasn’t pretty,” he and his teammates were thrilled with the result, which brought Iceland up to six points in the group. Albanian coach Edoardo Reja didn’t mince words when asked about the final score, however, saying that Iceland’s win was “undeserved,” and that it was the kind of match in which the team that scored first was likely to come out the victor. “As I’ve said many times, Icelanders are very strong physically – particularly in the air – and as such, Albania kept the ball mostly on its own half of the pitch and tried to find a hole in Iceland’s defense. That would have been possible if the game had evolved differently. But then we made terrible mistakes in our defense, such that three players were like bowling pins – just stood there and did nothing but make horrible mistakes. It was that kind of game – where the team that scored first was more likely to come out victorious.” The match was a scrappy one, with Iceland on the receiving end of more fouls than Albania. When asked if his team had played a rough game, Reja replied that it was “…a hard game, but football is a hard game” and moreover that he thought that Iceland’s players had a tendency to dive rather easily. Regardless of how elegant the match was (or wasn’t), Johann Berg reiterated that it was an important one for Iceland to win, both in terms of the points earned and the expectations it sets for Iceland in the long term. “Everyone’s been saying that we’re old, tired, and the game wasn’t sold out, which is unusual for us. We were determined to win the match.” Iceland is currently in third place in their qualifying group, on six points. Turkey is in first place with nine and France is in second with six. The team’s next match will be against Turkey on June 11. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1
1003,Iceland Review,Three Icelanders Summit Everest,2019/05/24,"Bjarni Ármannsson, Leif­ur Örn Svavars­son, and Lýður Guðmunds­son reached the top of Nepal’s Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, on Thursday. Mbl.is reports that Bjarni arrived in the morning, while the other two Icelanders arrived in the evening. As of today, then, nine Icelanders have now accomplished this feat. This is the second time that Leif­ur Örn has summited Everest. He previously did so in 2013, when he took the North Route to the top of the mountain, which is considered more difficult. He is the only Icelander to have ever completed that route and is also the only Icelander to have ever climbed the mountain twice. Lýður is the third Icelander to complete what is known as the Adventure Grand Slam, which involves the climber reaching the top of the highest mountain on every continent, as well as reaching the North and South Poles. Only two other Icelanders have completed the Grand Slam: Lýður’s Everest-summiting comrade Leifur Örn, and Haraldur Örn Ólafsson. Bjarni is the former CEO of Glitnir Bank and the current CEO of Iceland Seafood. A picture showing the summit at the time of Bjarni’s arrival was published on the Facebook page Mount Everest 8848M. “Mt Everest witnessed a traffic jam near the balcony area after more than 200 climbers attempted to reach the summit point this morning,” read the caption. Björn Ólafsson, Einar K. Stefánsson, and Hallgrímur Magnússon became the first Icelanders to reach the top of Mt. Everest on May 21, 1997. After that, Haraldur Örn Ólafsson reached the summit on May 16, 2002. Ingólfur Geir Gissurarson reached the peak on May 21, 2013 at the age of fifty; Leifur Örn Svavarsson reached the summit (his first time) two days later.

1004,Iceland Review,World’s Northernmost Cricket Ground to Open in Iceland,2019/05/16,"Iceland Cricket will open the world’s northernmost cricket field this month in Hafnarfjörður. At a latitude of 64.07°N, the field will break the record currently held in Umeå, Sweden (63.84°N) by 25km (15.5mi). It will be officially inaugurated on May 26 by Prime Minister of Iceland Katrín Jakobsdóttir. The even will feature an exhibition match between a Prime Minister’s XI, captained by Katrín, and a British Ambassador’s XI, captained by Michael Nevin. Modern Icelandic cricket was founded by Ragnar Kristinsson, who watched the famous world cup semi-final between Australia and South Africa while on holiday in Cyprus in 1999. The first practice sessions took place at Elliðaárdalur and the first local teams competed in 2000. Today, Iceland has cricket clubs in Reykjavík, Kópavogur, Garðabær, Hafnarfjörður and Seltjarnarnes. Iceland even boasts a national cricket team, which played its first international game last summer, beating Switzerland 330 to 115. Kit Harris, who runs marketing and advertising for Iceland Cricket, says that Iceland’s cricket history goes much further back. Along with historian Tom Holland, he believes there is evidence that the Viking game “knattleikr,” as described in Egil’s Saga and several other sagas, is the ancestor of the modern game of cricket. The exhibition match on opening day starts at 1.00pm and is free and open to the public. As is customary at cricket matches, English tea and cakes will be served. Update May 20, 2019: A previous version of this article stated the cricket ground would be officially inaugurated on May 24 by the President of Iceland. The correct day is May 26, and the inauguration will be led by Prime Minister of Iceland Katrín Jakobsdóttir. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

1007,Iceland Review,Iceland Wins First Euro 2020 Qualifying Match,2019/03/23,"Iceland’s national men’s football team won its first UEFA EURO 2020 qualifying match against Andorra on Friday, RÚV reports. It is the team’s first victory under new coach Eirik Hamrén, following the departure of Coach Heimir Hallgrímsson, who led the team to their historic World Cup debut in 2018. Much as expected, Iceland took control of the game from the start and Birkir Bjarnason took the first shot on goal only eight minutes into the match. Minutes later, Ari Freyr Skúlason made a great cross to Alfreð Finnbogason in the goal area, but surprisingly, Alfreð’s shot went right over the goal. Andorra had five corner kicks in the first 20 minutes of the game, but didn’t manage to make anything of these opportunities. In the 22nd minute, Iceland got its first corner. Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson directed the ball to Ragnar Sigurðsson, who headed it into the far post. Birkir Bjarnason was quick to take a rebound shot, which finally found its target. The score was 1 – 0 at the half. The second half got off to a slower start, with very little action for the first 15 minutes of play. Rúnar Már Sigurjónsson then came in for captain Aron Einar Gunnarsson. Aron, who underwent knee surgery in April 2018 after sustaining an injury while playing for Cardiff City F.C., immediately had to ice his knee after coming off the field, but is expected to be in good shape to play Iceland’s next qualifying match against France in Paris on Monday evening. Viðar Örn Kjartansson came in for Alfreð Finnbogason in the 70th minute and ten minutes later, he received a right cross from Birkir Már Sævarsson and scored the second and final goal of the match.

1014,Iceland Review,Three Highline Over Dettifoss,2018/09/28,"Two Frenchmen and one British man performed a remarkable feat on Thursday when they ‘highlined’ across Dettifoss waterfall, RÚV reports. Highlining is a sport similar to tightrope walking or slacklining, in which participants “traverse a narrow, springy band of rope suspended high above the ground.” In this instance, the three highliners walked a rope that spanned 270 meters [886 feet] and was roughly 100 meters [328 feet] above the waterfall, which has the greatest volume of water of any waterfall in Europe. The trio are part of a larger highlining team that travels around the world practicing their craft. When they first arrived at Dettifoss, they hadn’t decided on an exact location for their crossing. But when a rainbow appeared over the waterfall when they were scouting, they decided to base their crossing location on where they saw it. It seems only fitting, then, that several rainbows appeared in the same spot during their crossing on Thursday. “Some people were afraid,” said Bjarni Karls­son, a park ranger at Vatnajökull National Park who himself watched the crossing. “But most people were interested and excited.” Highliner Daniel Laruelle says the sport is like a meditation. “If you manage to stay calm then you enter a quasi-meditational state on the line. It works more often than not, but when there’s a lot of stimuli around you—like, for instance, a giant waterfall or a bunch of rainbows, then it can be difficult to keep your focus,” he admitted. But the teammates insist that the practice is actually safer than it looks. “As soon as I’ve secured the safety,” said Daniel, “I can go out on the line and fall as often as I want.” His teammates Nicolas Pouchars and Theo Sanson agreed. “It is actually more dangerous to drive a car around than it is to go out on the line,” said Theo. “Although your head says something else. We do this because it’s fantastic, but it’s also symbolic. We are all looking for balance in our lives, but it is a long process and takes us a lifetime.” See pictures of the three men’s remarkable, rainbow-embellished crossing on RÚV here.

1016,Iceland Review,Golfer Loses Eye After Lava Accident,2018/09/07,"A golfer lost an eye following an accident at a Hafnarfjörður golf course in South Iceland a few weeks ago, Vísir reports. The victim was a highly experienced Icelandic golfer in his sixties, who was taking part in an open tournament at the course. The accident took place when the golfer was on the fifth hole, along a section of the fairway appropriately called Hraunið, or ‘The Lava.’ The man’s first shot saw the ball land in some lava that surrounds the course and so he decided to try and hit it back onto the green. On one of his attempts, the golf ball hit a a lava stone that was very close to the ball [about one metre, or three feet away] and which was protruding about ten centimetres [three inches] out of the ground. The ball ricocheted backwards off the rock and hit the man directly in the eye. According to course manager Ólafur Þór Ágústsson, the man hadn’t even seen the stone when he hit the ball. An ambulance was called to the scene and the golfer was taken into surgery soon after, but doctors were unable to save his eye. According to Vísir’s sources, some consider him lucky, despite the horrible consequences of the accident; had the ball hit him in the temple, it could have killed him. Golf course manager Ólafur Þór Ágústsson said that the staff were shocked by the incident, but that luckily, these sorts of accidents are very uncommon. He did say, however, that balls do sometimes get hit into the rocks and/or lava surrounding the two different fairways and then ricochet off of them. “But this is by far the most serious [incident] that we’ve had happen at the course. There’s been nothing that compares to this. But people have been close to [having things happen]. In this sport, as in any other, accidents happen,” he said, and they can’t always be foreseen. “It’s just horrifically bad luck.” The golf course’s management is now considering increasing the number of drop spots in areas with a lot of lava, which may decrease player risk along those sections of the course.

Iceland went into the match at the top of Group 5, with 16 points. Germany was ranked second in the group with 15 points. Had Iceland won, they could have been certain of a direct qualification. Only the group winners will go directly through to the next round, while the four best-ranked teams from the European qualifiers will have to go through additional playoffs. Iceland started their sold-out homefield match looking strong, keeping the pressure on their opponents and preventing them from seeing much of the ball. As the first half progressed, Germany slowly won more possession but Iceland’s defense remained strong until the 42nd minute, when Svenja Huth scored. The first half ended 0 – 1, Germany. Germany came out looking much stronger at the start of the second half, while Iceland had trouble keeping possession of the ball or making any goal opportunities for themselves. Svenja Huth then scored a second goal in the 74th minute. The final score was 0 – 2, Germany. The result puts Germany in first place in Group 5, with 18 points, while Iceland falls to second place with 16. Germany’s last group match will be against the Faroe Islands, a game they are expected to win easily. As such, they will almost definitely go straight through to the next round.

1023,Iceland Review,Iceland Men’s Football Coach Resigns,2018/07/24,"Heimir Hallgrímsson announced this morning his decision to step down as coach of the Iceland men’s national football team, RÚV reports. He explained the decision at a press conference at 11.00am this morning. Heimir was appointed as assistant coach when Lars Lagerbäck took over the men’s team in 2011. He became co-head with Lars in 2014, leading the team to the UEFA Euro Championship quarter-finals in 2016. Heimir then took over as the team’s only head coach, leading it to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in it’s history. Heimir says he has worked well with everyone involved in the national men’s team. “I’m really proud and it’s a privilege to be able to leave the situation the way it is today,” he stated. “It’s great to say how much more professional everything has become than it was. We have a very well-defined work environment.” “Maybe then the question arises: then why are you leaving if everything is so great?” Heimur remarked. “If I were to continue, I would probably continue with the same focus, the same emphases, and at some point the motivation would fade, fatigue would come.” Heimir added that the team’s success is not attributable to just one person, and that there were too many individuals responsible to thank each by name. His next career move is yet to be decided, Heimir says, adding that he had received inquiries from both national and regional teams. Although he is interested in applying his skills outside of Iceland, Heimir says the time has not yet come to make a move abroad. ",Sport,0,0,0,0,0,1

A little rain did not seem to bother the crowd, which followed along with the game enthusiastically. “It’s incredible. There’s a lot of pressure,” said one French viewer during the second half. “We can’t believe that maybe in 20 minutes we’re going to win this World Cup[…] We’re just praying.” The gathering included a considerable number of Frenchmen, who joyfully celebrated their team’s second-ever World Cup victory, 20 years after the first. “It’s definitely awesome to be here in Iceland, and to win against Croatia,” said one French fan after the game, adding that he was only eight years old when France won their first World Cup in 1998. “It was really stressful, but really amazing,” said another supporter, before being interrupted by a screaming fan.

1027,Iceland Review,To Russia With Love (the short version),2018/06/05,"September 6, 2013. It’s a warm fall evening in Bern, and Iceland squares up against a much-fancied Switzerland side in a World Cup qualifying match for. Iceland, led by Swedish coach Lars Lägerback and his assistant, Heimir Hallgrímsson, have performed admirably so far in qualification. The dream of playing in fabled Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro, the home of football in Brazil, is still distant, however. After an unexpected Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson opener, the Swiss team appears to be a number too big for the Icelandic players, as Iceland find themselves 4-1 down 54 minutes in. After a quickfire Icelandic equalizer, Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson steps up as he scores two breathtaking goals to draw the Icelanders level and complete his hat-trick – the first one that an Icelander has ever scored in a competitive match. The image of the Icelandic team celebrating still lingers in people’s memories. That night in Bern gave both the nation and the team a newfound belief – and Iceland hasn’t looked back since. Five years later, Jóhann Berg is gearing up for the World Cup tournament in Russia. Although the surroundings will be different, the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow will be the setting of the same spectacle as the sandy beaches of Brazil promised some years back. The Icelandic team came so close in 2013, losing a play-off matchup against Croatia. The Croatians wait again this time around, as they have been drawn with Iceland in a group. Jóhann Berg is riding high into to the tournament, as he enjoyed a fantastic season with unfancied outfit Burnley in the English Premier League. He was voted into the ESPN Team of the year for players outside England’s top six and has provided 8 assists along with goals against stalwarts such as Liverpool and Manchester City. If anyone is ready for the World Cup, it’s Jóhann Berg Guðmundsson. We picked Jóhann’s brain on the upcoming World Cup, beating England at the EURO 2016, and his Counter-Strike skills. Jói Bern and playoff heartbreak After the hat-trick in Bern, Jóhann Berg received the apt nickname Jóhann Bern. “That night in Bern helped the team immensely. We saw how good we could really become. It was one massive step in the process of us going to the World Cup. It was a magnificent night for Icelanders as well as me personally. I will always look back fondly on that night.” The dream of qualifying for Brazil 2014 ended abruptly, however, in a two-legged playoff against Croatia. At the time, many Icelanders felt that they had lost their one and only chance and the players struggled with the defeat. “It was difficult to recover from that blow. There were many who believed this was the closest we would ever come to qualifying for the World Cup. What helped us immensely was to recover by qualifying for the EURO 2016. Then we managed, incredibly, to seal our ticket to the World Cup by coming in 1st place in a group with four teams who played at the EURO 2016.” World Cup fever Iceland is the smallest nation ever to reach a World Cup tournament, so Icelanders are eagerly waiting for the matches in Russia this summer. Qualifying for the World Cup is way bigger than we realize, I think. In a few years, we will look back on these achievements and realize how great they are. I’m just trying to enjoy the moment while it lasts.” He also recognises the pressure they’re under, as the team was the darling of the EURO 2016. “When you perform well, it makes people sit up and notice. There is pressure on us to do well after our performance at EURO 2016, but I’m not stressed about it. I am just going to play football at the World Cup and have fun. We can do great things if we give 100% in every match.” An Icelander in England The famous victory against England at the EURO tournament meant a lot for Jóhann as he lived in England during his teenage years, as well as currently playing in England. “It was extra sweet to beat England. Everybody in Iceland watches English football, and most support England at international tournaments.” Jóhann was on the books of Premier League clubs Fulham and Chelsea as a youngster but suffered an injury which forced him to return to Iceland “I got the taste of being a professional which gave me the extra motivation to return abroad to play. I knew I had the chance after I played one season at home in 2008, and that’s when I received my first international cap as well.” Jóhann was in England when they played at the 2006 World Cup, “If you told me I would play at the World Cup twelve years later with Iceland, I would have thought you were crazy. It was, of course, a dream of mine, but I thought it would never happen.” The multitalented footballer Jóhann Berg’s talents are not only showcased on the football field, as he is rumoured to have been a skilled player in the shooter video game Counter-Strike, “I played it a little bit too much at one time. I was good and enjoyed playing with my mates. Let’s just say I was not as good in Counter-Strike as I am at football.” Jóhann recently released a football trivia game in Iceland named Beint í mark, and fancies himself as a bit of a football trivia master “I know quite a lot about football as I both read extensively and watch a lot of games. I think I do alright.” The golden generation? Iceland has a great squad of players who play for each other, but what sets the team apart from other teams? “It is very difficult to break us down defensively, so we don’t concede a lot of goals. Couple that with the fact that we always believe we can score, you’ve got a great formula. We’re a difficult side to face as we’ve got big men up top who can win every header.” But is the current generation a so-called ‘golden generation? “It’s not a sure thing getting such a group of footballers together, we’re incredibly lucky. Everybody is willing to run until their lungs burst and we also happen to be good footballers. It’s going to be difficult to get another generation like this, but hopefully qualifying for big tournaments becomes a habit. We need to keep the same values we have today in order to enjoy success in the future.” Facing superstars Iceland’s opening match at the World Cup is against Argentina, where the players will face off against the genius of Lionel Messi. The Icelandic team faced a similar situation at the EURO tournament when the first challengers were eventual champions Portugal, starring the world-class Cristiano Ronaldo. When asked about the phenomenal challenge of facing Lionel Messi, Jóhann Berg remains undaunted “These are two of the best footballers in the world, it would be pure joy to get a result against Argentine as we did against Portugal. These players are on another level and play a completely different brand of football than we do. We will do everything to shut down Messi just as we shut down Ronaldo.”  Heimir Hallgrímsson During Heimir Hallgrímsson’s reign as the Icelandic national team’s manager, Iceland has enjoyed unprecedented success, qualifying for the EURO 2016 and will now step on the grandest sporting stage of them all, the World Cup. By doing so, Iceland became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament. Heimir’s honest approach to work and life has gained him many admirers. A testament to how beloved he is by his countrymen, a hop-heavy pale ale named Heimir has recently been specially brewed in his honour. We sat down with the charming Heimir to discuss his background in dentistry, his philosophy, and how he plans to stop Lionel Messi this summer. Team Iceland vs. Messi Iceland will face off against Argentina, Croatia and Nigeria at the World Cup and the first hurdle at the tournament will be stopping Lionel Messi on the 16th of June in Moscow. “We always work as a team, even when facing superstars. We would never ask one player to stop Lionel Messi, it would be unfair. We do everything together – that is our philosophy.” Teamwork and unity is what sets Iceland apart from other teams. According to Heimir, “Our identity is based on working as a team. There are certain fields we want to be the best in and these are different from other nations. We are unique due to the players’ hard-working nature and unity we display on the field”. Sharing top secrets Heimir started out as assistant coach to Swede Lars Lagerback in 2011, at a point when interest in the Icelandic team was at a low and the team hovered around 130 on the FIFA World Rankings. Since Heimir’s work with the team started, Iceland has progressed step by step and is now ranked as the 22nd best footballing nation in the world. He took it upon himself to meet Tólfan, the Icelandic supporters group, in a small pub before the Icelandic team’s home matches. In the meeting, he discusses tactics and discloses the team’s starting line-up, sometimes even before the players themselves know the starting eleven. “Our relationship is on another level. This is unthinkable for other national teams. When we started out there were only seven people attending in a small room. It has grown since then, along with our respect for each other.” Heimir is not afraid to disclose secrets to the select group of fans, “No one wants to destroy this by leaking anything out.” The optimistic Icelanders The Icelandic nation eagerly awaits the World Cup, but what can the Icelandic team achieve at the tournament? “Optimism is in Icelander’s DNA so the people want us to win all of the matches in the group – it is simply in our nature. We are realistic however and know that we can everybody as well as lose. Even if we play our best possible match we can still lose against nations like Argentina. I think the best philosophy is to try to enjoy the tournament and approach the World Cup in as relaxed a mood as is possible. If we do our best, we have a chance” Dentist turned coach Heimir is a dentist by profession, having tended to the teeth of residents of the remote Vestmannaeyjar archipelago for years. Having now turned his attention fully to the national team, dentistry work is never far away. When attending a match in the women’s top division in his hometown, Heimir was called upon when a player lost a tooth after a clash. In typical unfazed fashion, Heimir drove her to his nearby office and stuck the tooth back in. His background as a dentist has helped him as a manager, as well “As a dentist, you deal with different people throughout the day. The person in the chair might be relaxed, anxious, agitated or desperately frightened. This one-on-one work helps when dealing with football players as you have to treat different people in different ways.” The unorthodox coach Heimir’s experience as a football manager differs from most of his colleagues at the World Cup. Heimir has a unique background as he started working as a youth coach with 6-year olds, progressing his career step by step towards coaching women. Transitioning from coaching women to the men’s game is a rarity in football. Since he started working with the Icelandic team he has risen from assistant coach to joint manager and after the EURO 2016, he was hired as the sole manager. “I think that no-one at the World Cup has taken this route in coaching – having such a long career as a youth and women’s coach. One role has led to another as I’ve always been trusted with larger roles. I have never in my life thought ‘What next?’. When I was coaching 6-year olds I really enjoyed it, living in the present and feeling good. Then when I coached a top division women’s team, ÍBV, I thought that was the biggest role I would take on. When you are in the present you give it your all and good things happen to you”. The World Cup – a different beast The Icelandic football association has felt the increased interest level around the World Cup. “When Iceland Review comes to a press meeting held by the Football Association of Iceland, it shows that the interest level is tremendous. There have been television crews here from Brazil, Japan, China and Argentina here for weeks on end. It is a great promotion for Icelandic football as it gains more respect worldwide.” When asked if the current success is sustainable, Heimir is not short for answers “The current atmosphere is that this success is completely normal – while there are large nations who have not made it to the World Cup. This team have gotten us to a place where we are among the best – which is a fantastic achievement. People will not realize for about 2 or 3 years how far this team has come. If we attain this level for years to come, we will not always qualify for large tournaments – but if we are in the fight it is a gigantic step for such a small footballing nation as Iceland is.” Heimir for president? After the Icelandic team’s success at EURO 2016, there were many who called for the Swedish coach Lars Lagerback to run for the President of Iceland. When asked if he will be in the same position if Iceland performs well at the World Cup, Heimir laughs “I know President Gudni Th. Jóhannesson well enough, and he can do no wrong. If he puts on the wrong pair of socks it simply becomes a trend. There is no-one who will overthrow him unless he decides to leave himself.” On that note, we say goodbye to Heimir and wish him well for the challenges waiting at the World Cup – Áfram Ísland!
