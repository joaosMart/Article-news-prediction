First we decided to scrape the central bank own website but we got the response status code 403 in the federal reserve (USA central bank) website and the european central bank despite not showing the 403 status code it seemed that we couldn't access the news using beautiful soup. Hence we had to go look for some second hand news about these two central banks. For this task we found \"The Guardian\" webiste to be very useful and that is what we decided to scrape."
